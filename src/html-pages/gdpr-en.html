    <h1>Data protection</h1>
    <h3>General</h3>
        <p>By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use of data in accordance 
            with the following description. This website can generally be visited without registration. Data 
            such as pages accessed or names of files accessed, date and time are stored on the server for 
            statistical purposes without this data being directly related to your person. </p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it possible to store specific information 
            related to the user on the user's terminal device while the user is using the website. Cookies make it 
            possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and number of users of the pages, to analyze 
            behavior patterns of page use, but also to make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies remain stored 
            beyond the end of a browser session and can be retrieved when you visit the site again. If you do not wish 
            this to happen, you should set your Internet browser so that it refuses to accept cookies.</p>
        <p>The storage of cookies can be achieved by disabling them in the browser settings. Please note that in this case 
            not all functions of this online offer can be used.</p>
    <h3>SSL/TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content. 
            You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from http:// 
            to https:// and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
        <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <h3>Server Log-Files</h3>
        <p>The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, 
            which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
            <ul>
                <li>Browser type and Browser version</li>
                <li>Operating system used</li>
                <li>Referer URL</li>
                <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
                <li>Time of the server request</li>
                </ul></p>
        <p>This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. This data is not merged with other data sources. We 
            reserve the right to check this data retrospectively if we become aware of specific indications of illegal use.</p>
    <h3>Third party services</h3>
        <p><b>Matomo Analytics</b></p>
        <p>We use the open source software Matomo. This is a web analysis platform that helps us to optimise our website. 
            For this purpose, cookies are used to collect information about website usage (e.g. pages accessed, duration of 
            access, browser data) so that usage behaviour can be evaluated and weak points identified. Your IP address is 
            anonymised immediately; you as the user thus remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>The information obtained about website use is transmitted exclusively to our servers. The data collected is 
            not passed on to third parties.</p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>All information on our website has been carefully checked. Nevertheless, the occurrence of errors can not 
            be completely excluded, so we can not guarantee the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of information. 
            Liability claims regarding damage caused by the use of any information provided, including any kind of information 
            which is incomplete or incorrect, will therefore be rejected.</p>
        <p>The publisher/editors may change or delete parts of the pages or the entire edition at their own discretion and without 
            notice and are not obliged to update the contents of this website. The use of or access to this website is at the visitor's 
            own risk. The publisher/editors are not responsible for damages, such as direct, indirect, incidental, consequential 
            or punitive damages, allegedly caused by the visit of this website and consequently assume no liability for such damages.</p>
        <p>The publisher/editors also accept no responsibility or liability for the content and availability of third-party 
            websites that can be accessed via external links on this website. The operators of the linked sites are solely responsible 
            for their content. The publisher/editors thus expressly distance themselves from all third-party content that may 
            be relevant under criminal or liability law or that may offend common decency.</p>
