    <h1>Dank</h1>
    <p>First and foremost, we would like to thank the team of the Iron Library, who drove the edition project forward with motivation, enthusiasm and perseverance and who maintained both the enjoyment and the quality until its completion.</p>
    <p>We would also like to express our gratitude to Georg Fischer Ltd, without whose generous financial, personnel and non-material support the realisation of this edition would not have been possible.</p>    
    <p>We would also like to thank the numerous external partners who contributed their professionalism and expertise to the edition project for their pleasant and profitable collaboration. Their names are listed in the imprint.</p>
    <p>We would like to thank the interested readers in advance for their in-depth study of the travel journals. The hopefully lively use for private reading or academic research is the most important and rewarding confirmation of the project.</p>
    <p>Finally, we would like to thank the numerous GLAM institutions who, in the spirit of Creative Commons, have made their valuable image collections available digitally for free use. This project would not have been possible in this way without them.</p>
