                <p>With the intention of visiting <persName ref="gfa-actors-7384">my second youngest son</persName>, who for some years now has enjoyed the good fortune of being able to devote himself to the study of <term ref="gfa-keywords-604">chemistry</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-3048">physics</term> at the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1818">Imperial and Royal Polytechnic Institute</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-247">Vienna</placeName>, and of becoming acquainted with this institution, which has few equals in <placeName ref="gfa-places-42">Europe</placeName>, as well as with the men under whose direction it is run, I travelled to Vienna in the <date to="1824-12-31" from="1824-09-01">latter part of 1824</date> and found my ex<pb n="4" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557745" break="no"/>pectations exceeded in every respect and myself more than amply rewarded for having undertaken the journey.</p>
                <p>— During my stay there, in addition to many highly esteemed acquaintances, I also acquired the friendship and goodwill of <persName ref="gfa-actors-7704">Baron von Jacquin</persName>, who is so highly respected in the field of natural sciences. He was kind enough to take me on one occasion to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2084" cert="0">Imperial Natural History Cabinet</placeName>, which contains such precious treasures of nature and art (<term ref="gfa-keywords-9323">mosaics</term>). I was amazed at the magnificent showpieces from the mineral kingdom, musing to myself: What wonder could have created this? What gnome cultivates the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9108">gold</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term> <pb n="5" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557746"/> trees to grow so happily in such precious splendor? Who gives color to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8504">malachite</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9269">lustre</term>? Who gives the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8982">precious stones</term> their radiance and all the colors of the rainbow, and who scatters the seed to the trunks and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9636">prongs</term> of the snowy <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron flower</term>? Have all you splendours already existed from the very beginning, or, as the sightless poet <persName ref="gfa-actors-7904">Milton</persName> suggests, have you condensed from invisible ether? Do you remain immutable, just as the outermost darkness has produced you, together with the dual elements: warmth and moisture, or the evanescent chemical fire, hidden from view by the earth's crust? <pb n="6" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557747"/> Or are you, too, subject to the eternal law that all earthly matter must first become, grow and mature, and that time alone transforms it from one shape to the next? But who can declare it so? Who has been given the privilege of peering into the secret workshop of nature? — And yet, more than this earthly matter, I was attracted by that which seems to belong to other worlds. I mean the most strange meteoric masses occurring as stone and as solid iron, always equally strange, whether they be debris of perished worlds, floating in infinite space, following the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9142">gravitational law</term> of our earth, <pb n="7" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557748"/> in whose sphere they enter, or outgrowths of the fire vents of the moon, or products of energized chemical compounds of primordial substances in the higher regions of our atmosphere. The wonderful, seemingly heterogeneous (and nevertheless consisting of homogeneous substances) structure of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9010">meteoric iron</term>, which Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7966">von Widmanstadt</persName> so wonderfully conceived and depicted, prompted me to pronounce to the <persName ref="gfa-actors-7704">Baron</persName> that upon my return home I should attempt to artificially reproduce the meteoric iron myself. I traveled from <placeName ref="gfa-places-247">Vienna</placeName> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1819">Trieste</placeName> and then on to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1820">Venice</placeName>. In the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1821" cert="0">arsenal</placeName> there, in the mag<pb n="8" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557749" break="no"/>nificent armory, I saw patterns on a number of <placeName ref="gfa-places-148">Turkish</placeName> swords of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8452">Damascus steel</term>, which appeared to be similar to those of meteoric iron. I began to think of making <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term> instead of meteor iron, and a long series of experiments, which I conducted after my return, convinced me that this and only this way, namely by combining <term ref="gfa-keywords-9471">nickel</term> with <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term>, would produce a genuine Damascene blade — Not wanting to be the judge in my own affair, I decided to seek judgment at the higher school of fine steelwork <pb n="9" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557750"/> and make this second trip to <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, during which I also kept my diary, as has long been my habit, and noted there details of those events I thought worth recording for myself and for the sake of recollection.</p>
                <p>As unexpected and, therefore, for me, all the more flattering, as the positive public reception of my <ref type="cross" target="../1814">diary of my earlier journey to England</ref> proved to be, I remain concerned whether it would not appear immodest to present it with another, as I was neither the master of the events nor of the objects shown to me, but rather had to take and <pb n="10" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557751"/> took everything as it came. Only the belief of my friends that one or the other useful or new thing would be made known through it, and their assurance that such a diary would be met with benevolence for its own sake, has finally convinced me to do so. Therefore, may my intention to make a contribution of some kind be received with goodwill.</p>

                <head>Schaffhausen–Audincourt, 26.–30. Mai 1825</head>
                <p><pb n="11" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557752"/> On <date when="1825-05-26">May 26th</date>, I commenced <placeName ref="gfa-places-131" type="itinerar" when="1825-05-26" n="1.0">the journey</placeName> to my intended destination via <placeName ref="gfa-places-10" type="itinerar" when="1825-05-26" n="1.1">Basel</placeName> and <placeName ref="gfa-places-1310">Montbeillard</placeName>, where I had business and wanted to visit some factories, in particular, the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1927" cert="0"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9519">cast steel factory in La Roche</term></placeName> that I had founded a few years earlier. I stayed in <placeName ref="gfa-places-10" type="itinerar" when="1825-05-27" n="2">Basel</placeName> on the <date when="1825-05-27">27th</date> and arrived in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1310" type="itinerar" when="1825-05-28" n="3">Montbeillard</placeName> on the evening of the <date when="1825-05-28">28th</date>, proceeding to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1583" type="itinerar" when="1825-05-29" n="4">Belfort</placeName> on the <date when="1825-05-29">29th</date> to view the <term ref="gfa-keywords-288">blast furnaces</term> there. Their construction is nothing less than state-of-the-art, that is, designed to reduce coal consumption; on the other hand, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9011">pig iron</term> is produced from the small, but very pure and homogeneous <term ref="gfa-keywords-8851">ore</term> there, which is the material for one of the best types of bar iron in <placeName ref="gfa-places-48">France</placeName>, and is especially good for shotgun <pb n="12" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557753"/> barrels, for which reason it is usually sent to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9112"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2226"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8292">weapons factory</orgName></placeName></term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1822">St. Etienne</placeName>.</p>
                <p>I had occasion to make several large-scale experiments to transform this <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term>, as well as iron from <placeName ref="gfa-places-1335">Besançon</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1313">Odincourt</placeName> and <placeName ref="gfa-places-1886">Hucel</placeName>, into <term ref="gfa-keywords-8482">cast steel</term> by direct <term ref="gfa-keywords-8696">melting</term> with the necessary additives, but none of them turned out as successful as the first one, which proved extremely durable with a high hardening capacity. Incidentally, here again, my manifold experience was confirmed that iron produced from <term ref="gfa-keywords-8653">clay ironstone</term> does not readily turn into <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term> without special handling.</p>

                <head>Geschäftsgänge in Audincourt und Montbéliard, 30./31. Mai 1825</head>
                <p>The <date when="1825-05-30">30th</date>. — I visited the large <term ref="gfa-keywords-9005"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2057" cert="0">ironworks</placeName></term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1313">Odincourt</placeName>, which formerly belonged to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1310"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7710">Prince of Mümpelgardt</persName></placeName> but now owned by Messrs <persName ref="gfa-actors-8133"><persName ref="gfa-actors-8134"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7838"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-7711">Saglio, Umene and Gash</orgName></persName></persName></persName>.</p>
                <p>This magnificent facility, located on the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1823">Doubs</placeName>, <pb n="13" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557754"/> truly warrants visiting, especially now that these gentlemen have had their <term ref="gfa-keywords-9245">rolling mills</term> made entirely after the English system, albeit all in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1824">Charenton</placeName>, near <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName>, by the Englishmen who have settled there. The <term ref="gfa-keywords-8644">main spiral beam</term> (hollow), the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9478">water wheel</term> and the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9477">spur wheels</term> are all cast from iron and weigh over 50,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-9858">kilograms</term> or 1000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term>. In addition to the beautiful <term ref="gfa-keywords-8993">sheet iron</term> of all types and the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9015">drawn iron</term>, some 5000 to 6000 pieces of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8638"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">tinplate of different guages</term></term> are also manufactured here daily, which have the greater advantage of softness in comparison to the English.</p>
                <p>The production, I might add, is quite like the English process I observed and described in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1786">Rotherham</placeName> eighteen years ago. — They are not quite satisfied with the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">rollers</term> yet, and Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7871">Jeanmaire</persName>, the director, confided to me that they would pay a handsome sum to anyone who would show <pb n="14" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557755"/> how best to make them.</p>
                <p>I spent the <date when="1825-05-31">31st</date> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1310">Montbeillard</placeName> on business, after which I visited the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1931" type="itinerar" when="1825-05-31" n="6" cert="0"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8293"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7940"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7963">factory of Messrs. Vincenti and Rogier</persName></persName></orgName></placeName>, which is located in the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1825">castle</placeName> and not open to the public. Here, various machines are made and used to produce all of the parts for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9590">clocks</term>. The process is automated down to the smallest detail, even the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9742">polishing</term>, without the aid of manual dexterity, so that the only thing to be done is set it in motion, for which Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7963">Vincenti</persName> once used <term ref="gfa-keywords-9187">dogs</term>, but later replaced them with <term ref="gfa-keywords-9213">children</term>. The main idea, or prevailing principle, here, is that the movements of the pieces and the instruments that work on them are so precisely regulated, carefully observed and controlled using integrated <term ref="gfa-keywords-8539">magnifying glasses</term>, <pb n="15" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557756"/> that the contours, whether curved or straight, necessarily emerge with the strictest rigor. The resulting forms, that is to say, the finished, elaborated pieces, are impeccable.</p>

                <head>Montbéliard–Calais, 1.–6. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>On <date when="1825-06-01">June 1st</date>, I travelled from <placeName ref="gfa-places-1310" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-01" n="7">Montbeillard</placeName> via <placeName ref="gfa-places-1583" type="itinerar" n="8">Belfort</placeName> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-118" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-04" n="9">Paris</placeName>, where I arrived on the <date when="1825-06-04">4th</date> at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I then booked a place on the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8570">diligence</term> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName> for the following day and was glad, after I had written these words, to have a little rest.</p>
                <p>On Sunday, <date when="1825-06-05">June 5th</date>, at 9 o'clock in the morning, I left <placeName ref="gfa-places-118" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-05" n="10">Paris</placeName> with only one traveling companion, who, as he said, was headed for <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> to conduct a trial for someone there and preceeded to bore me to distraction with his legal punditry.</p>
                <p>At 4 o'clock in the afternoon we arrived in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1826" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-05" n="11">Beauvais</placeName>, some 18 hours from Paris, in the morning of the <date when="1825-06-06">6th</date> <pb n="16" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557757"/> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1827" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-06" n="12">Montreuil</placeName> and at 6 o'clock in the evening in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1607" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-06" n="13">Calais</placeName>, where we slept.</p>
            </div> 
            <div type="day">
                <head>Calais–London, 7. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>On <date when="1825-06-07">June 7th</date> at 5 o'clock in the morning, I embarked on the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8801">steamboat</term> the Mountaineer. The weather was favourable, the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2005">sea</placeName> quite calm, the gears whirring, as the ship swiftly cut through the waves, and before we knew it, we were already at sea off the coast of Langnose, where the shores of <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">Albion</placeName> lay spread out before us like an expansive map.</p>
                <p>And so — I thought to myself — and so I see you again, you curious island, you imperious ruler of five regions of the world!  You, island to which, when eighteen years ago I left the smouldering, <term ref="gfa-keywords-8931">cycloptic</term> workshops of your country, the ever-increasing industry of your people in the production of everything that clothes and nourishes and sustains humankind, <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London's</placeName> endless bustle, and your ship-filled <term ref="gfa-keywords-9405">ports</term> forebodingly at the end <pb n="17" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557758"/> of <ref type="cross" target="../1814">my diary</ref> that it would not be the last time. Your steep, snow-white banks rise up gloriously in the sunshine, forming a border with the lush green meadows, at the edge of which there stand now <term ref="gfa-keywords-9271">lighthouses</term>, now country houses, now castles built in the new age after the old style. Structures that today house the hospitable chambers of wealthy landowners, rather than the halls of arms of the knights of King <persName ref="gfa-actors-7768">Arthur's</persName> ancient time. Sometimes austere, one might say somber, like the cult that erected them, lonely churches stand in the middle of the field, sometimes quaint villages hidden among trees and dark green hedges, sometimes walled factories, where tall, smoking chimneys announce the activities of the boundless force of English industry, appear alternately and repeatedly in ever-changing forms. — May my intellect find the strength <pb n="18" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557759"/> to comprehend, even fleetingly, so many strange and remarkable things.</p>
                <p>The party travelling aboard the steamboat was not very large on account of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9481">coronation festivities</term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName>. Three ladies with their ladies-in-waiting and a child of five months, whom the sea voyage appeared to suit better than its guardian and mother, an attorney, who was also a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9288">nobleman</term> from Paris, with whom I had my own hardship, since he understood no English at all, had never travelled before, and was about 60 years old, and five Englishmen, including a priest who wished to climb up the rope ladder to the crow’s nest for his own amusement (for the ship has two masts in addition to the bowsprit<note>Eine fest mit dem Schiff verbundene, über den Vorsteven bzw. das Galion hinausragende starke Spiere, die das Vorstag zum Abstützen des Fockmasts trägt.</note>), but this was denied him, and two very learned, well-travelled gentlemen who had been in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1828">Calcutta</placeName> and <placeName ref="gfa-places-12">Pecking</placeName>. The steamboat was, as <pb n="19" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557760"/> most now are, admirably equipped. It is 110 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> long, 25½ feet wide, goes 9 feet into the water, carries 250 tons or 5000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term>, has two “double acting” <term ref="gfa-keywords-8587">Watt steam engines</term>, each of 36 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">horsepower</term>, and covers ten <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">English miles</term> in an hour. Each voyage, including crew wages and capital interest, costs the contractors 60 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>, of which 24 is for heating. Each passenger pays 33 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shillings</term> in first class, 22 shillings in second class, 2 pounds and 10 shillings for a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9277">carriage</term>, 3 pounds for a horse and 5 shillings for a dog. Halfway, we caught up with a steamboat the <persName ref="gfa-actors-8135"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9491">“Queen of Holland”</term></persName> coming from <placeName ref="gfa-places-473">Rotterdam</placeName>, which we had seen long before and was moving in the same direction, and left it far behind us before we reached the point where the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1829">Midway</placeName>, on the right, and the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1641">Thames</placeName>, on the left, mix their sweet <pb n="20" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557761"/> water with the salty ocean tides. — Soon thereafter, the steamship Lord Melville, sailing from <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1607">Calais</placeName>, greeted us with raised flag and, by and by, we caught sight of several more in different directions, their black swirls on the endless sea resembling pillars of smoke in the desert. — Among the ever-changing pictures, two appeared at the same time and therefore more prominently, a ship returning from the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1938">East Indies</placeName> and one bound for there. The experienced men on our deck estimated the tonnage of each at 200 to 250<note>This estimate is too low. It would have had to be 2000 to 2500 centner.</note>, or 4000 to 5000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term>, and the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8802">armament</term> at 40 to 50 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8717">cannons</term>. — Those who have made long voyages on the sea can imagine the feelings of happiness on the part of those returning home and the hopes and fears of the others facing the half-year voyage. <pb n="21" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557762"/> — The appearance of the ships prompted a discussion of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9494">steamboat</term>, moored in the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1641">Thames</placeName>, whose departure for the East Indies was scheduled as early as <date to="1825-03-31" from="1825-03-01">March</date>. The coals it was to take on board from the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1964">Promontory of Good Hope</placeName> left as ballast with several ships at the <date to="1825-03-31" from="1825-01-01">beginning of the year</date>. However, the ship has not yet been completed due to a <term ref="gfa-keywords-174">conspiracy</term> of the carpenters, who demand a higher wage and are now trying to get one. They have not been able to work at all, but live from their own funds and mutual support. It has two <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term>, each of 80 horsepower, built by Messrs. <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7571">Boulton and Watt</orgName>, for propulsion and is commanded by the famous <persName ref="gfa-actors-7875">Joner</persName>, a highly experienced and daring sailor.</p>
                <p>Arriving at the mouth of the Thames, I was struck by the full significance of <pb n="22" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557763"/> <persName ref="gfa-actors-7947">Schiller's</persName> description of this river, so very true and poignant:</p>
                <p><emph rend="italic">Ships in thousands go there and depart-<lb/>There are seen the costliest works of art,<lb/>And the earth-god, Mammon, reigns supreme.</emph></p>
                <p>I dared to venture even the darkest idea of the capital value of these innumerable ships and their cargoes, English property all, yet it was quite impossible, alas, I could but marvel.</p>               
                <p>One must be just to all nations, though some are more so than they seem, for in their progress they often struggle against circumstances and difficulties not generally known, yet they themselves are often unjust. Still, this is certain, that, all other things being equal, the English must be the most industrious and the most shrewd. <pb n="23" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557764"/> For, in the end, given the known quantity of their available hands and even the approximate total power of their steam engines, one can surmise by comparison that only through extraordinary physical industriousness and effort, into which the intellect has everywhere been poured and absorbed, could all that one sees be made possible in the given time – in this estimation I also include the many new <term ref="gfa-keywords-8969">dockyards</term> through which ships now appear in the midst of buildings and in the landscape, as well as the new bridges and roads in <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, and the new buildings, of which it is claimed that 26,000 were built in the year before last, and even 40,000 in the last year, which is very nearly a miracle.</p>
                <p>Just below <placeName ref="gfa-places-1640">Gravesand</placeName>, public health officials came aboard ship, and a little <pb n="24" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557765"/> further on, the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9301">toll officers</term>, who remained aboard.</p>
                <p>I was delighted to see in the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1641">Thames</placeName> the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9797">ship</term><note>Fischer glaubt hier, James Cooks berühmtes Schiff <emph rend="italic">Endeavour</emph> zu sehen. In Wahrheit handelte es sich jedoch um die <term ref="gfa-keywords-9796">«Discovery»</term>, die von einem anderen englischen Entdecker, nämlich George Vancouver (1757–1798), kommandiert wurde.</note> with which the famous <persName ref="gfa-actors-7800">Cook</persName> circumnavigated our globe, but less delighted to discover it had now been turned into a prison ship for criminals, since it was once commanded by such an excellent man and bold sailor.</p>

                <head>Ankunft in London, 7. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>At 5 o'clock in the evening, after we had covered 120 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">English miles</term> in less than 12 hours, we landed at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1830" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-07" n="14" cert="0">Tower Stairs</placeName> near the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1832">customs house</placeName>. We were not allowed to take anything with us, not even our night bags. Only under supervision were we permitted to take what we needed from them, before being politely informed that we could collect everything at 9 o'clock the following morning. Having moved into <placeName ref="gfa-places-1932" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-07" n="15" cert="0">my old quarters</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1611">Cheapside</placeName>, I made the long journey to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1831" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-07" n="16" cert="0">Trougmorton Street</placeName>, <pb n="25" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557766"/> where I collected a letter of introduction from State Councillor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7814">Delarive</persName> of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1196">Geneva</placeName> to the famous chemist of the <placeName ref="gfa-actors-1703"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-7575">Royal Institute</orgName></placeName>, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7469">Faraday</persName>, and to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1833" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-07" n="17" cert="0">Grafton Street</placeName>, to visit a friend of <persName ref="gfa-actors-7740">my eldest son</persName>. That same evening, I obtained a description and drawing of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9094"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7753">Perkin's steam engine</persName></term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9495">shotgun</term>, as well as that of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9670"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7825">Brown's pneumatic or vacuum engine</persName></term>, and on my evening walks I enjoyed the completely odorless <term ref="gfa-keywords-8533">gas lighting</term> that had now been installed in the streets and houses, of which I only note that for the street lamps there are curved spouts extending from the houses, and usually along the sidewalk, beautiful, <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">10-foot-high</term>, hollow candelabra of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term>, the former serving as suspension points and the latter as supporting points for the lanterns. — In the streets, the large pipes <pb n="26" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557767"/> 4 feet below the pavement are of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term>. The small, lateral pipes leading up to the houses are of forged iron, and in the houses themselves of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term>. The light fixtures in the houses themselves are the responsibility of the owners. My landlord must pay 6 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term> annually for two <term ref="gfa-keywords-8615">Argand lamps</term> in the dining room, which must sometimes be kept burning until 3 o'clock in the morning and which provide enough light to read every printed word at the end of the room, which amounts to about 12 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8444">kr.</term> a day. — In my experience, the butchers and grocers enjoy the greatest luxury of gaslight. Flame torches, not lamps, rise from their multi-armed chandeliers through wide glass cylinders up to 9 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> high with a diameter of 1½ inches. The flame is hollow, flowing as it does from a flat ring pierced with 16 to 20 holes of ⅒ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8541">linear</term> diameter, but it is <pb n="27" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557768"/> all the more brilliant for the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9421">oxygen</term> of the atmospheric air can enter from within. — I wrote a letter <placeName ref="gfa-places-131"><persName ref="gfa-actors-6139">home</persName></placeName> to inform them of my arrival and at midnight concluded the day's work and the hardships of my journey.</p>

                <head>Bekanntschaft mit Michael Faraday, 8. Juni 1825</head>
                <p><date when="1825-06-08">June 8th</date>. In <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, as in all large cities, money can buy everything, even time. As paradoxical as the proposition may seem in and of itself, it is nevertheless true in a certain respect – namely, that by means of hired carriages or <term ref="gfa-keywords-8909">“Cabriolet”</term>, which admittedly cost money, one gains at least twice as much time as if one is compelled to serve as one's own wretched means of transport. Considering all of that early this morning and calculating that merely to pay the necessary visits and conduct my business, I would have to walk at least 16 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">English miles</term> criss-cross (I mention only the outermost points, the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1832" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-08" n="18">“Custom <pb n="28" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557769"/> house”</placeName>, to get my baggage, and then the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7575"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1703" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-08" n="19">Royal Institution</placeName></orgName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1696">Albemarle Street</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1630">Picadilly</placeName>, to visit Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7469">Faraday</persName>, I made use of the very convenient arrangement of hired carriages, so as to accomplish all my preparations in one day. — At the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1832">customs house</placeName>, the “Searcher”, to whom I gave 1 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shilling</term> upon his discreet suggestion of a tip, was not very rigorous in his examination of my suitcase, though he did bring my <term ref="gfa-keywords-9367">travel pistol</term> to the head officials. Is this pistol made in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>? they asked. I answered: No. Their expressions were doubtful, so I continued: I visited England eleven years ago, too, and had such a gun with me. It is for my own safety, which no one guarantees. — Where did you enter [the country]? At <placeName ref="gfa-places-1608">Dover</placeName>. And what did the gentlemen from the custom house there say? <pb n="29" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557770"/> They told me to keep it. — And so you shall.</p>
                <p>The priest, who yesterday wished to climb up to the crow’s nest, did not fare as well. A beautiful silk scarf, which he had brought from <placeName ref="gfa-places-48">France</placeName> for his sister, was mercilessly confiscated, despite all objections.</p>
                <p>Amusing, but characteristic, was the description of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9288">nobleman</term> by the boatman who brought us from the steamship to the shore. “Tell that gentleman,” (he turned to me as I had spoken English to him earlier) “with that little <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silverlit</term> on his coat that i shall get a coach ready for him if he wants one.” I faithfully translated the words of the <pb n="30" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557771"/> honest <persName ref="gfa-actors-8291">Jack</persName> to my travelling companion, however, they did not seem to edify him much.</p>
                <p>With impatience, I hurried to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1696">Albemarle Street</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1630">Picadilly</placeName>, to the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7575"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1703">Royal Institution</placeName></orgName>, in order to make the personal acquaintance of the highly skilled <term ref="gfa-keywords-8917">chemist</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9312">metallurgist</term> employed there, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7469" type="met">Faraday</persName>. Open and friendly, as Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7814">Delarive</persName> had described him to me, he took me, instead of the visitor’s room, straight down to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-2324">laboratory</term>, which I had imagined would be much larger based on a drawing in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9644">Journal London and Paris</term>. The laboratory serves its purpose, though the one in <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName> at the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1934">Ecole des Mines</placeName> is beautiful and the one at the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1818">Polytechnic Institute in Vienna</placeName> is truly imperial both in its dimensions and equipment, which attests to the true magnificence of that institution in every respect. After some conversation on other matters, I showed Mr. Fa<pb n="31" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557772" break="no"/>raday some processed pieces of my <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term>, by whose beautiful patterns he was astonished, but even more so by its quality: the piece of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9412">saber blade</term>, the edge of which can be filed, could cut through an <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> rod three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8541">lines</term> thick without suffering in the least. He was also impressed that the two extremes of hardness and dynamic elasticity could be accomplished in the same steel with equal success, namely <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razors</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9645">hammer springs</term>. He was equally struck by the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9106">packfong</term> I had made shortly before my departure, which entirely different from the usual compositions of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8787">alloy</term>. Its toughness, unusually white color, and the fact that it tarnishes less than silver seem to give it a certain advantage over all known types <pb n="32" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557773"/> of this <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term> alloy. — Leaving Mr. Faraday, after receiving an invitation to attend the lectures on <term ref="gfa-keywords-604">chemistry</term> by Professor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7483">Brande</persName>, secretary of the Society, one morning, I went to the celebrated and accomplished gun manufacturer, Mr. <placeName ref="gfa-places-1630"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2050" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-08" n="20" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7823">Joseph Egg (Picadilly)</persName></placeName></placeName>, inventor of the “Copercapes” now commonly used for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9115">percussion rifles</term>. He was pleased to meet me, as <persName ref="gfa-actors-7740">my eldest son</persName> had worked for and with him <date to="1822-12-31" from="1822-01-01">three years ago</date>, and instructed me where and how I could obtain a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9708">caveat</term> for the invention of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term>.</p>
                <p>It was 7 o'clock in the evening when I arrived <placeName ref="gfa-places-1932" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-08" n="21" cert="0">home</placeName>, and I spent the remaining hours until midnight in the company of three dear compatriots, one of whom has been living in <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName> for 28 years, the others <pb n="33" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557774"/> having only recently arrived. — Nothing pleases me more than when our young people, especially artists, craftsmen and manufacturers, visit England. Most of them, even after their return to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">homeland</placeName>, retain the spirit of perseverance, perfection and accomplishment that resides here, and not without some effect. However, it is almost indispensable that they know at least something of the English language beforehand if they want to derive the full benefit from their stay here.</p>

                <head>Londoner Highlights, 9. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <placeName ref="gfa-places-89"><date when="1825-06-09">9th</date></placeName>. This morning, after I had previously inquired at the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1936" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-09" n="22" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7572">office which Mr. Watt has in the city</persName></placeName>, whether he was here or at his <placeName ref="gfa-places-1723">manufactories</placeName> at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1693">Soho</placeName> near <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, and to my pleasure heard the latter, I returned <persName ref="gfa-actors-7469"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1703" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-09" n="23">to Mr. Faraday</placeName></persName>. He was kind enough, as I had inquired of him about an oil-gas facility, to introduce me to Mr. <pb n="34" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557775"/> <persName ref="gfa-actors-7855" type="met">Hennel</persName> at <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8136"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1834" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-09" n="24" cert="0">Apothecarys Hall</placeName></orgName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1690">Union Street</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1841" cert="0">Bridge Street,</placeName> who happened to be in at the time. Since both types of illumination with <term ref="gfa-keywords-9220">coal</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">oil-gas</term> were installed adjacent to each other in this significant institution and were administered by the most skilled <term ref="gfa-keywords-8917">chemists</term>, I hoped to obtain the most reliable information on this contested subject, as well as on the most expedient installation for the thing itself. For the time being, however, they all agreed that where <term ref="gfa-keywords-2570">coals</term> are inexpensive, coals should be used, and where oil is inexpensive, oil should be used. I then reported to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1614" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-09" n="25">Alien Office</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1842" cert="0">Crown Street</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1843">Westminster</placeName>, so as not to be imprisoned for four weeks, as is so charitably promised on the arrival certificate, in the event of failure to report within seven days. Today, was <term ref="gfa-keywords-9760">“Drawing Room”</term> day, which takes place less frequently under the <persName ref="gfa-actors-7839">present king</persName> <pb n="35" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557776"/> as under the previous one, where everyone and everything that is presentable appears at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1846">court</placeName> in formal dress. Since there were certainly more than a hundred of the most beautiful equipages on the streets leading to the royal residence, they were all filled with spectators of both sexes, especially to see the luxuriant and stylish dresses of the ladies. — I was delighted, in addition to these, by the bizarre costumes of the coachmen, livery attendants and “Footmen”. I shall describe those of a single <term ref="gfa-keywords-9277">carriage</term>. On the coach were three people: the coachman in the middle, somewhat aged, with a round red face, a daintily curled round wig, an isosceles triangle hat with silver trim, a hanging tassel and an epaulette, a yellow coat of silk, judging by its shine and fineness, short leggings and a white vest and white silk stockings, the shoes <pb n="36" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557777"/> adorned with large silver buckles. The two servants next to him on the driver’s box, young and pale in appearance and dressed, incidentally, like the coachman, boasted respectable hair bags in place of the decorative wig. The two footmen also wore bags in the back and, in addition, as a sign of their office, each carried a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8535">cane</term>, which they never touched to the ground. — To fight the boredom of their wait, the men passed the time quite pleasantly with a “Tankard-Porter”<note>Trinkkrug gefüllt mit Porter, einem dunklen, oft tiefschwarzen Bier mit einem malzigen oder gar röstmalzbetonten Geschmack.</note>, which they passed around amongst them, to which they ate buttered bread layered with meat, which in the language of gastronomic art is called “<term ref="gfa-keywords-9864">Sandwichers</term>”. — Elsewhere it would be considered improper to eat in the street, here, it seems to me, it is not so. At a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9204">print shop</term>, I saw a tall man, certainly <pb n="37" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557778"/> a gentleman by his dress, calmly eating the marrow of a coconut while looking with a critical eye at a depiction of a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8565">Quaker</term> couple on their wedding night.</p>
                <p>This publication and several insignificant ones concerning the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9859">emancipation</term> issue now under consideration are the only things available for the public’s amusement. In general, since <persName ref="gfa-actors-7840">Gillnay's</persName> death, the print shops, these erstwhile playgrounds of party spirit, wit and satire, seem to have diminished greatly. — My route continued through <placeName ref="gfa-places-1630">Picadilly</placeName> past the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2018" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-09" n="26"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8742">“Exhibition of ancient and modern Mexico”</term></placeName>, and on to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1652">Leicester Square</placeName> past the reproduction of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2018" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-09" n="27"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9647">Egyptian tomb</term></placeName> discovered by <persName ref="gfa-actors-7777">Belzoni</persName>. I lingered for a long while in these pseudo-halls of the dead. Full of the impression that this most strange scenery had made on me and entrusting the most significant <pb n="38" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557779"/> to my memory until tomorrow, I postpone the recording of what inspired me most, as I am too fatigued to write.</p>

At 8 o'clock in the morning, I set out in order to arrive at precisely 9 o'clock in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-2324">laboratory</term> of the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7575"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1703" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="28">Royal Institution</placeName></orgName> for the lecture on <term ref="gfa-keywords-604">chemistry</term> that Professor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7483" type="met">Brande</persName> delivers each day, together with the appropriate experiments, from 9 to 10 o'clock to an audience of sixty to eighty persons of vastly different ages. — While fluent in English, I was concerned, nevertheless, that I might not fully understand him. However, his clear, slow pronunciation and the great precision of his (unaided) lecture made all my worries superfluous. He discussed <term ref="gfa-keywords-9646">sulfur</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9415">saltpetre ethers</term>, in turn; presented them; mentioned their effects in the formation of detonating <term ref="gfa-keywords-9310">metal oxides</term>; showed, on charts that were <pb n="39" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557780"/> quite ingeniously visualized, the weight and proportion of their elements, as well as the changes in volume produced by the chemical compound; proceeded to second-degree fermentation, or <term ref="gfa-keywords-9030">vinegar fermentation</term>, and demonstrated how it can be made pure and odorless in the final stage. He then turned to the extraction of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9183">wood vinegar</term> by <term ref="gfa-keywords-8967">distillation</term>, mentioning, which I cite as a useful suggestion for our factories, the extraction of wood vinegar by <term ref="gfa-keywords-8905">charring wood</term> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8727">powder manufacture</term> and discussing in succession the various <term ref="gfa-keywords-8776">acetates</term> and their use in the arts and in <term ref="gfa-keywords-581">medicine</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8918">surgery</term>. In general, he referred continuously to the practical application of the subjects he discussed, did not get involved in any hypotheses when discussing phenomena that could not yet be fully explained, but stated that chemistry must remain a purely experiential <pb n="40" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557781"/> matter and concluded with the announcement that tomorrow he would discuss the third degree of fermentation or the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9389">putrefaction</term> of animal substances, but that in general he would conclude this year's course in chemistry within eight days. — I was very sorry not to be able to attend the entire course, but I am even more sorry that in my own beloved <placeName ref="gfa-places-131">hometown</placeName> nothing at all has been done to promote this science, which cannot be appreciated enough. I will add what I saw yesterday concerning the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9647"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7777">tomb discovered by Belzoni</persName></term>.</p>

The <placeName ref="gfa-places-2018">building</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1652">Leicester Square</placeName>, which contains a replica of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9647">royal tomb</term> discovered by <persName ref="gfa-actors-7777">Belzoni</persName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-3">Egypt</placeName>, is furnished in its interior, but only on a scale one-third its natural size, and the staircases, halls, columns, compartments and wall deco<pb n="41" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557782" break="no"/>rations are uniformly represented as they were in reality. However, as no daylight can be tolerated in these dwellings of the dead and, owing to the structure, none can penetrate them, there are, at the entrance, on the stairs and in the corners of the halls and rooms, pedestals with portable hollow metal spheres, in which <term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">oil-gas</term>, compressed to a pressure of 30 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8962">atmospheres</term>, burns and, due to the small openings from which it flows, gives off only a pale light, which, as one enters to stand among these strange objects, which neither the eye nor the imagination of the observer has ever seen in this way, heightens and increases the imposing, one might even say eerie, quality of the whole. Belzoni's ingenuity and talent for discovery in suspecting a subterranean tomb in this place and finding the entrance, so artfully <pb n="42" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557783"/> hidden by the ancient Egyptians, is truly remarkable.</p>
                <p>Three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">English miles</term> from the ancient city of <placeName ref="gfa-places-2067" cert="0">Thebes</placeName>, at the foot of a steep hill, in the then dry bed of a brook, he dug, despite the objections of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1898">Arabs</placeName> he employed, and on the evening of the second day they discovered a rock that had been levelled at the top, so as not to protrude above ground. By noon they had reached the entrance that had been hewn out of the rock and lay 18 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> below the surface of the earth. This portal, whose walls and ceiling were painted with <term ref="gfa-keywords-9178">hieroglyphics</term> in the most beautiful colours, led to a staircase of 23 steps into the depths, at the end of which there was another gallery measuring 37 feet long and culminated in a walled cavity 30 feet deep, 14 feet long and 12 feet wide. — <pb n="43" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557784"/> On the opposite side was a small opening in the wall only 2 feet wide and 2½ feet high. Beams were placed across it, which now allowed access to the magnificent tomb of the king, which suddenly opened before them and consisted of several halls and galleries. In one of them was the body of an embalmed bull, in others statues partly of wood and partly of fine <term ref="gfa-keywords-8773">clay</term>, dyed blue and varnished over, and in the main hall a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9420">sarcophagus</term> of oriental <term ref="gfa-keywords-8782">alabaster</term>, half transparent, the walls only 2 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> thick, covered with hieroglyphics, but the lid broken and the body removed. This tomb, which for many reasons can be estimated to be about three thousand years old, had therefore already been penetrated by humans, most probably at the time of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2043">Persian</placeName> invasion of <placeName ref="gfa-places-3">Egypt</placeName>. — <persName ref="gfa-actors-7777">Belzoni</persName> refers to the main chamber as the Hall <pb n="44" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557785"/> of Beauties, in that when one is in its centre, one is surrounded by Egyptian deities. — All the figures are executed in such perfection that one can discern the finest ornamentation on their garments.</p>
                <p>The jambs of the doors are decorated with female deities, carrying the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8862">lotus</term> in buds and again in full bloom, surrounded with pictorial writing, and a serpent on a half-sphere above. One of the main themes of the objects carved in bas-relief and painted, is the reception of (presumably) Samni into the realm of eternal bliss by the noblest deities of the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>The new arrival, accompanied by the god <persName ref="gfa-actors-8013">Arueris</persName> (as indicated by the sparrowhawk head), makes sacrifices to <persName ref="gfa-actors-7867">Isis</persName> and other female deities, and is finally <pb n="45" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557786"/> accepted by <persName ref="gfa-actors-7922">Osiris</persName> (the supreme god) dressed in white, seated on the throne of glory, above which hovers a winged orb, and holding the crook in one hand and the flail in the other.</p>
                <p>The walls on both sides are covered in <term ref="gfa-keywords-9178">hieroglyphics</term>, which are positioned one below the other, and each row is separated from the other by lines 5 to 6 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term>, drawn from top to bottom, so that one might conclude with certainty that (just as the <placeName ref="gfa-places-29">Chinese</placeName> do) the Egyptians used to read this script from top to bottom.</p>
                <p>I was alone and had no guide with me to provide further insight. Time bade me depart from this place that captivated me beyond description, considering that we know some things no better now, <pb n="46" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557787"/> after three thousand years of experience, <term ref="gfa-keywords-8778">aeons</term> in relation to our short lives! — We have advanced in <term ref="gfa-keywords-3048">physics</term>, though not in metaphysics: the eternal laws, to which even the spirits we have created are subject, invariably prevail, and I wondered: is an unexpandable circle closed by the link we form in the chain of being? — Were these people as fortunate as we? — What was the sum of the wisdom of their gnostics? — I also noticed the following on three walls: The boatman of death on his barge with a king. Above the door a female figure with outstretched wings. Then, on the wall to the right, men carry a long, thin staff, at the end of which there are cow heads, and on which there are two bulls. Then twelve kings lying in their coffins of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9860">sycamore</term>. — Above seven of <pb n="47" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557788"/> them are <term ref="gfa-keywords-9178">hieroglyphics</term>. Over one I recognized the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9703">key of power</term>, over another three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8770">pyramids</term>, likely indications of what they had accomplished during their reign. Five died ingloriously. These twelve coffins lie atop a straight outstretched serpent, with only its head and tail canapé-like and curved outward, supported by four goat feet. These kings have a natural color in the coffins. Then, again, in another panel, one finds them black. They have descended to the kingdom of death and its regent, <term ref="gfa-keywords-8677">Amenthes</term>, and the judge of their actions, <persName ref="gfa-actors-7767">Anubis</persName>. The scales are in their favor. In the upper field they appear again, each under a green palm tree, and, as it says in the Revelation, with crowns on their heads and dressed in white clothes, symbol of eternal bliss.</p>
                <p><pb n="48" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557789"/> On the opposite side, so to speak, on the lambru, or lower section of the wall, there is a most curious procession of prisoners.</p>
                <p>They are preceded by the sparrowhawk-headed deity, who is followed by four red men with white aprons. Then four white men with thick black beards, their black hair tied in white nets, and wearing striped aprons bordered with fringes. Then come four Negroes with hair of different colors, large, round earrings in their ears, and dressed in short white belted garments that are attached to a band going over their shoulders. The similarity of the physiognomy of these people with that of our present day is striking. The human race has not changed for three thousand years. They are followed by four white men with short beards <pb n="49" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557790"/> and Van Dyke beards, feathers spreading out in both directions in their hands, and wearing clothes or cloaks over their shoulders, similar to the skins of wild animals. — On my way out, I stopped in the model room, where (in addition to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2086">temple of Ypsambul</placeName> near the second Cataract of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2035">Nile</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1922">Nubia</placeName>, and the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1848">pyramid of Sephrenes</placeName> opened by <persName ref="gfa-actors-7777">Belzoni</persName>, the base of which is 684 feet, the sloping line from the center of the base to the top 568, and the perpendicular height 453 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term>) the most interesting exhibit was the excellently preserved <term ref="gfa-keywords-9350">papyrus scroll</term>, 23 feet long and about 14 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> high. The latter is covered with hieroglyphics and painted figures. The principal scenes depict rural festivals, particularly the work of ancient Egyptians in the fields and the harvest festival. The end of the papyrus depicts the judgment of the soul, <pb n="50" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557791"/> though not the earthly judgment of the dead, as practiced in Egypt, but the heavenly one. — The great god <persName ref="gfa-actors-7922">Osiris</persName> sits in his temple on the throne. The various deities, the scales of judgment, and how the soul is introduced into the temple provide ample impetus for reflection on the religion of the inhabitants of this strange land in that time soon following the Flood.</p>

                <head>Bekanntschaft mit Jacob Perkins, 10. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>After conversing with Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7469" type="met">Faraday</persName> about the subjects discussed in the lecture, he gave me a letter to Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7753" type="met">Perking</persName>, who attracted the attention of all <placeName ref="gfa-places-42">Europe</placeName> with his various ingenious inventions and especially recently with his <term ref="gfa-keywords-9495">steam flint</term>. I first sought out this strange man at his <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7920"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1849" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="29">syderographic workshop</placeName></orgName>, No. 69 <placeName ref="gfa-places-2026">Fleet Street</placeName>. <pb n="51" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557792"/> However, he was not there, but at his <placeName ref="gfa-places-1850" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="30"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8944">steam engine manufactory</term></placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-2027">Regents Park</placeName> near the Diorama, which, unfortunately, is at least a quarter of a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">mile</term> away from the former. — Anyone who knows <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName> can imagine the roads I had to travel. Although my letter was very approving, I recognized that he did not much care for strangers in the factory, to which an inscription on the door forbade unauthorized access, and he immediately remarked that he was sorry that he could not show me anything, as he was making improvements to his steam engine, for which he intended to take out a <term ref="gfa-keywords-239">patent</term>, in which case it would be detrimental to him if the matter were known in advance, and with regard to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9495">steam gun</term>, he was no longer allowed to shoot, because the people in the park had complained about it. — I replied: As much as it would interest me to see his things, I had not real<pb n="52" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557793" break="no"/>ly come for that purpose, but rather to make his personal acquaintance and to show him something that might be useful to him in his <term ref="gfa-keywords-2856">syderography</term>, namely my newly discovered <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9474">meteor steel</term></term>; and then I wished to know whether his machine could be easily adapted for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8801">steam navigation</term>. He then showed me a model of a vessel built for this purpose, which had no gears, but a horizontal spiral beam at the rear, where the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8644">steering wheel</term> would normally be, rotating very quickly by means of gears and a drive, to which four angled rudders were attached, which looked like windmill blades and cut vertically into the water. I remarked to him that I had seen the same device <date to="1803-12-31" from="1803-01-01">twenty-two years</date> ago in <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName> on the famous <term ref="gfa-keywords-9648"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7836">“Fultons Diving boat”</persName></term>, which astonished him somewhat. <pb n="53" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557794"/> He told me he had also known <persName ref="gfa-actors-7836">Fulton</persName> well. From that, we proceeded to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9649">bélier hydraulique</term>, for which I gave him my calculations, and it was not long before he led me, first, to his 10 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">horsepower</term> <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term>, then to the workshops, then to the place where he fires the steam gun, and where I collected many of the lead fragments from the bullets that had been fired by steam at a hundred and twenty paces, and, finally, to the room where the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9380">hydraulic press</term> is located, with which he conducts his unusual compression experiments.</p>
                <p>It differs from ordinary presses in that the walls of the cylinder are seven <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> thick, and that it has a very ingenious indicator attached to it, which measures the voltage of an equal number of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8962">atmospheres</term> of pressure each time.</p>
                <p><pb n="54" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557795"/> He maintained, and even showed me the pipes where this took place, to have produced air in liquid form at a pressure of two thousand atmospheres. That, as well as that last week he fired one thousand bullets in one minute with the steam gun, I would not report had I not heard it directly from his lips. — I was obliged to take my leave of him, as I was scheduled to depart for <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName> the following day and still had a great deal of business to which to attend. Upon his request and a definite promise on my part to return, I departed. If the eye and the physiognomy are more or less the reflection of the soul and whatever images of the past or present that concern it, then I believed I could gather from his friendly, earnest eyes, which looked as if to higher heights, that the <pb n="55" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557796"/> realm of knowledge will be indebted to him for more than one discovery and that the pursuit of great ideas will occupy him more than the mere acquisition of earthly matter.</p>

            <div type="day">
                <head>Fischer im London Journal for Arts and Sciences, 10. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>Due to a delay at <persName ref="gfa-actors-7753">Perkins</persName> and the long journey, I did not meet Messrs. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7483">Brande</persName> and <persName ref="gfa-actors-7855">Hennel</persName> at <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8136"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1834" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="31" cert="0">Apothecarys Hall</placeName></orgName>, where I had gone to see the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8533"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">oil-gas lighting</term></term> apparatus. — They had appointed a minder to show and explain everything to me when I arrived, but, preferring to have my information from the source, I asked him to advise the gentlemen that I would return tomorrow.</p>
                <p>As I had an appointment with <placeName ref="gfa-places-2050" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="34" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7823">Mr. Egg</persName></placeName> for lunch at 5 o'clock, and therefore could not undertake anything more important, I browsed with considerable leisure through the beautiful stores from <placeName ref="gfa-places-1611" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="32">Cheapside</placeName> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1630" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="33">Picadilly</placeName>, that is, for those who do not <pb n="56" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557797"/> know London, almost an hour's walk. — The only thing that struck my attention during this cursory inspection was the amount of people offering soda water, ginger beer and bear lard for sale. — “Soda Water” (a chemical preparation of common water, which is saturated with lots of carbonic acid gas along with some dissolved soda), as the waiter at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1932" cert="0">my inn</placeName> explained to me, is for “for cooling, when Gentlemen have to much drunk and feel dry”.</p>
                <p><term ref="gfa-keywords-9194">“Gingerbeer”</term> is good for the stomach, and bear lard is for growing hair.</p>
                <p>At the Strand, in a respectable store where genuine <term ref="gfa-keywords-8824">“Bearsgrease”</term> is sold and the hunt for these animals in the Arctic regions, now undertaken by the <placeName ref="gfa-places-402">British</placeName> industry with redoubled zeal, <pb n="57" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557798"/> is further illustrated by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-2837">copperplate engraving</term>, young gentlemen wishing to mature quickly, and because it is supposed to be attractive to the ladies, are guaranteed with said lard, to their great consolation, “a fine whisker warranted in 2 months”.</p>
                <p>The conversation with Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7823" type="met">Egg</persName> proved to be very interesting for me, as it concerned mainly those things that are my own main preoccupation.</p>
                <p>I felt obliged to leave him my <term ref="gfa-keywords-9368">revolver lock</term>, which has a percussion spring made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term>, for still closer examination. He said: He never would have believed that such <term ref="gfa-keywords-9645">springs</term>, and at the same time <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razors</term>, could be made of the same steel, as the properties of both were extremes, and their combination in one and the same material almost a paradox. He viewed the <pb n="58" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557799"/> blade of a hunting knife made of meteor steel through the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9315">microscope</term> and said, as he handed it back to me, “the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8452">watering</term> is wonderfully beautiful”. It appears that the expression wunderschön, so popular in <placeName ref="gfa-places-35">Germany</placeName>, has now made its way into the English language, as well. — After having taken my leave of him at about 8 o'clock for reasons of business, I was surprised, upon arriving at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1932" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-10" n="35" cert="0">my residence</placeName>, to find, by an unknown hand and without further written notice, the November issue of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9650">London Journal for Arts and Sciences</term> from <date to="1823-12-31" from="1823-01-01">1823</date> in which I found the literal translation of my essay, read two years earlier to the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8103">Helvetic Society for Natural Sciences</orgName>, on the results I had obtained with respect to various steel alloyings and especially those with <term ref="gfa-keywords-635">alumium</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term>. I was not displeased.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="day">
                <head>Rundgang in Apothecaries Hall, 11. Juni 1825</head>
                <p><pb n="59" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557800"/> <date when="1825-06-11">June 11th</date>. This morning I went to <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8136"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1834" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-11" n="36" cert="0">Apothecarys Hall</placeName></orgName>, where, to my pleasure, I met Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7855" type="met">Hennel</persName>. — This splendid institution, which is the apothecary school of <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, and where preparations of all kinds are made on a large scale, and, as will be evident from what follows, with such facilities as are not to be found anywhere, is as little an institution of the government, or supported by it with pecuniary aid, as the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7575">Royal Institution</orgName>, which, owing to its name, many would like to believe. Both exist only through the association of a self-contained corporation, and in fact <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8136">Apothecarys Hall</orgName> existed earlier than the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9651">great fire of 1688</term><note>Der als Great Fire of London bekannte Brand ereignete sich nicht im Jahre 1688, sondern 1666.</note>, in which, according to a Latin inscription above the entrance, it was also destroyed, but rose again like a phoenix from the ashes. — We proceeded immediately to the building where <pb n="60" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557801"/> the oil-gas apparatus is located. Its simplicity and practicality are equally remarkable. The main idea in the preparation of oil-gas (here <term ref="gfa-keywords-9047">fish oil</term> is used, of which a ton costs 24 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>, or a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term> about 44 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">fl.</term> Reichsgeld) is to have it fall drop by drop, or in a gentle stream, into an iron <term ref="gfa-keywords-8882">retort</term> filled with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">"Coaks"</term> or, in the absence thereof, with pieces of brick, and made red-hot, so as to produce the gas by decomposition of the same. Of course, this can be done in various ways; however, care must be taken that all the oil is broken down, as otherwise part of it will be released in the form of vapor and thus lost, or condensed back into oil in the wrong places. As I requested permission to take a drawing of it on the spot, I will only describe its construction generally, and provide some <pb n="61" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557802"/> data on fuel consumption and output. — There are two generators, each with retort and furnace, so that gas production is never interrupted, though only one furnace is used at a time. — Each retort, which consists of a pipe bent into the shape of a horseshoe, has two  pipes rising perpendicularly from the furnace, through one of which the oil, which is in the copper vessel located between the two furnaces, drips in, and the drip is regulated by a spigot, while, through the other, gas is fed to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8954">condenser</term>, which consists of a square, elongated, airtight iron box, inside a slightly larger one, into which cold water continuously flows in and the heated water flows out. This condenser is connected to the upper part of the oil vessel by a neck or tube which passes <pb n="62" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557803"/> through the cooler, so that the oil formed from any undecomposed steam can be recombined with the oil supply and fed back into the retort. — Underneath the large oil vessel, likewise between the two furnaces, is a second condenser, from which the gas coming from the first condenser is further cooled and purified, and flows through a main pipe in its upper floor into the cylindrical <term ref="gfa-keywords-8550">gasometer</term>, designed like any other; on the bottom of this second condenser, which is not surrounded by water, is another pipe with a spigot, so that if oil should accumulate there, it can be drained. Every hour, about 1 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8618">gallon</term> or 7½ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term> of oil is broken down, providing 80 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">cubic feet</term> of gas, and 1 <term ref="gfa-keywords-9652">bushel</term> of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8474">coal</term> is <pb n="63" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557804"/> is burned to turn about 10 gallons of oil into gas. — The gasometer holds 900 to 1000 cubic feet and is sufficient to provide gas for 6 to 7 hours to 70 usually <persName ref="gfa-actors-7738">argand</persName> lights. — The copper vessel in the center holds about 16 gallons or 120 pounds of oil. The two ovens in which the retorts are located are especially well made. They are <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> boxes, the walls and lids of which are all joined together with screws, so that if anything is damaged on any side, it is only necessary to remove the wall and repair what is defective, or even easily remove the retorts, without destroying the whole or weakening it, which inevitably happens with ovens constructed otherwise. — The whole apparatus, made by Messrs. <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7803">Tailor und Martineau</orgName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, cost 170 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>. It would <pb n="64" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557805"/> perhaps not be so difficult to make it even more efficient and durable. — All the facilities in this extensive building are well worth seeing. — The plant juices are pressed out by the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9399">Real press</term> and brought to the proper consistency by steam in large boilers, which are made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term> or fine <term ref="gfa-keywords-8706">tin</term>, depending on the nature of the liquid to be processed, as these boilers are always inserted into a larger iron one, all the way up to the top, however, where they are hermetically connected, with a space of a few inches in between. — At the bottom, the steam enters the iron boiler through a tube and can be closed or admitted by means of a spigot. This configuration has the great advantage, as the surface area is remarkably large in relation to the mass, <pb n="65" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557806"/> that with rapid and uniform evaporation, during which the mass is continually stirred, the most precise degree of the required consistency can be achieved, and there is never any danger of an empyreumatic taste being imparted to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8965">decoction</term> by excessive local heat. — <term ref="gfa-keywords-9646">Ether</term> <term ref="gfa-keywords-8967">distillation</term> is also done by steam, but how? — In a very large “Boiler” made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">half-inch-thick</term> forged <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheet metal</term>, the steam is brought to an expansion force of one hundred <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term> per square inch, which I verified with a close inspection of the safety flap, and then surrounds the distillation apparatus. For absolute safety, due to the highly inflammable nature of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8464">atmosphere</term>, this is done in an entirely different room than where the boiler is located, which delivers the steam at such a high rate <pb n="66" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557807"/> and on the boiler itself there are two safety valves. One allows the worker to inspect and adjust its pressure, while the other remains inaccessible and commences operation when the expansion force of the steam exceeds the normal voltage by even the slightest amount. — Equally useful and on a large scale are the facilities for ordinary <term ref="gfa-keywords-8967">distillation</term>, for the drying of salts, the preparation of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8792">ammonia</term> and of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9416">hydrochloric </term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9653">nitric acids</term>. Regarding the latter, I would like to mention the remarkable circumstance that the receptacles, each with a capacity of about 3 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">cubic feet</term>, like those made commonly of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9861">glass</term>, are here made of earthenware and fitted at the bottom with a neck of the same material, which seals off air and liquid and is joined at the time of manufacture. — For the health and economy of <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London's</placeName> inhabitants, this facility is equally <pb n="67" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557808"/> beneficial, since the preparations produced by it are conscientious, pure and unadulterated, and, because they are made on such a large scale, they are inexpensive. This, however, does not prevent <term ref="gfa-keywords-9391">quackery</term> or, as it were, poison mixing, especially as concerns <term ref="gfa-keywords-8927">cosmetics</term>, which are promoted far more extensively here than even in <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName>. To illustrate how far they go in this endeavor, I quote verbatim the promises of only one: "To remove and 'obliterate' the 'vulgar Red' that obscures natural beauty, etc., <persName ref="gfa-actors-8290">Pears'</persName> aromatic cream is recommended as an object of too great an importance to be neglected by persons in those moments which they are accustomed to devote to their personal appearance. <emph rend="italic">Victoria veritatis</emph>."</p>

                <p>After lunch (as usual between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening) busy with <pb n="68" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557809"/> packing, I was surprised to see it had already gone half past 7 o'clock. I paid 2 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term> for an "Inside" fare to <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, which is 109 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> away from <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, and left London with the pleasant prospect of soon being reunited with several of my esteemed friends. The traveling party on the inside — outside was all full on account of the fine weather — consisted of only two persons, a "Gentleman" from Birmingham and a "Lady" from London, who was bound for <placeName ref="gfa-places-1852">Holy Head</placeName>, 200 miles out of London.</p>
                <p>Her lover, or husband, accompanied her as far as the place where we got on. She wept profusely as she bid him farewell and covered her face in a thick black veil. With the rays of the sinking sun, she removed it, however, having purchased some <term ref="gfa-keywords-9370">bitter <pb n="69" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557810"/> oranges</term> for refreshment when we stopped for a moment at the end of town, so that we were now illuminated by a different star.</p></div>

As it is said of the ladies in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> that they often possess as much strength of spirit as the gentlemen themselves, I believe to have perceived this in our traveling companion, insofar as she so completely conquered the pain of separation as to promise the gentleman, who had already begun his attempts to comfort her during the journey, that she should stay a full day in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName> that he might continue his efforts.</p>

He had had visitors and had left with them shortly before my arrival.

                <p>Monday, the <placeName ref="gfa-places-20"><date when="1825-06-13">13th</date></placeName>. I was primarily interested in visiting a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8973">steel-wire drawing manufactory</term>, and where possible, obtaining some of their <term ref="gfa-keywords-9655">drawn iron</term>, and finding out whether any manufacturer could produce a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8980">ductile</term> metal similar to <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term>, to mine or to <term ref="gfa-keywords-9106">packfong</term>, and whether it would not be possible, <pb n="72" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557813"/> in combination with my own experiences, to lift the mysterious veil over the production of their so-called most remarkable <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">malleable cast iron</term> which is flexible when both cold and hot, or to largely penetrate this veil, so that I might become acquainted with the casting and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8641">tinning</term> of the so-very-thin, delicate and practical kitchen utensils. To this end, I first made my plan, for the execution of which, in addition to knowing the language and customs of <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">this country</placeName>, one always needs an "Introduction", whether through one's own devices, that is, with a plausible reason, or through someone acquainted and respected. Today, I managed to secure the latter and was so fortunate as to find full support for my intentions with the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1855" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-13" n="40" cert="0"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8294">banquier</orgName></placeName>, where I was previously known, <pb n="73" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557814"/> in that the first comissioner gave me a list of the names of the manufacturers I wished to see and where I wished to make my purchases, along with particulars of their place of residence, and the son<note>Es kann nicht eruiert werden, welcher der beiden Söhne, James Moilliet (1806–1878) oder Theodore Moilliet (1810–1886), gemeint ist.</note> of the <persName ref="gfa-actors-7860">head</persName> of the house was gracious enough to offer to accompany me there himself the following day.</p></div>
            <div type="day">
                <head>Innovation Getränkepumpe, 13. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>— I concluded this day with another very detailed examination of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8525">beverage pump</term> introduced in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> in the most distinguished <term ref="gfa-keywords-9234">inns</term>, as well as in the most common pub, which provides all possible advantages in saving time, in maintaining the freshness of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8829">beer</term> or other liquids, in reducing the spilling of the same, as much as possible, and even in preventing unauthorized consumption. In general, the system is as follows: In the cellar, into the barrel to be tapped, a <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metal</term> is inserted, which, instead of being completely open, is only perforated with tiny holes at the back, <pb n="74" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557815"/> so that no sediment or other impurities are able to enter. — At the front of this tap, by means of a metal connecting screw, which is similar to a hose screw, a tube made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8775">lead</term> or, if very meticulous, English <term ref="gfa-keywords-8706">tin</term>, is screwed on, which is then led through the floor of the room to the place where the drink is to be served. There is a narrow box, like the one we use for hand pouring, and also in the middle of the box, which has an upper and lower door, there is a hemispherical basin made of tin or <term ref="gfa-keywords-9038">faience</term>, where every spilled or overflowing drop immediately runs through a tube in the middle into a bottle placed beneath. The <term ref="gfa-keywords-2607">pump</term>, a small cylinder 2½ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> in diameter and 10 inches high, is screwed into the lower part of the box, the bottom of which is also fitted with the tube <pb n="75" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557816"/> coming from the cellar by means of a connecting screw. At the top, the cylinder is closed again, fitted with leather washers, except for a hole in the centre, in which the turned <term ref="gfa-keywords-9306">brass</term> piston rod rises and falls airtight. The piston has a brass, cone valve that opens upwards. Near the upper end of the cylinder is a hole in the side, to which is soldered another piece of pipe, which runs into the upper part of the box, and to which the tap that dispense the beverage is screwed. — At the top of the box is a notch through which the lever emerges, which is connected to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8702">piston rod</term>, and which in its proportions and functions is similar to the lever of an ordinary pump, but for the sake of convenience is very short and fitted with a handle. — On this certainly very sen<pb n="76" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557817" break="no"/>sible device, two details constitute the real secret, namely, the hole at the side and the fact that the cylinder is completely closed at the top, with the exception of the piston rod, which rises and falls airtight in the "Collar of leathers". — It goes without saying that the barrel to be tapped must never be more than some twenty <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> below the pump. Now, when the piston moves, the beverage rises into the cylinder and, when the piston is depressed, rises through a conical valve above the piston, which, when it is next raised, feeds it into the side tube, and the latter into the crooked spout to fill the glass. — In the "Coffee room" of the inn, I took <term ref="gfa-keywords-9558">tea</term> for my customary "Souper", and could not say, although there were eating and drinking parties at several tables, that I was disturbed in my thoughts. <pb n="77" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557818"/> The taciturnity<note>Schweigsamkeit.</note> of these islanders is quite extraordinary, and if on the day of judgement we are to give account for every useless word, they are least likely to be answerable for it than their neighbours across the sea.</p>

                <p>Tuesday, the <placeName ref="gfa-places-20"><date when="1825-06-14">14th</date>.</placeName> After making an appointment, I went with my <persName ref="gfa-actors-7860">friend's</persName> son<note>Es kann nicht eruiert werden, welcher der beiden Söhne, James Moilliet (1806–1878) oder Theodore Moilliet (1810–1886), gemeint ist.</note> to the various workshops and, with the exception of the large <term ref="gfa-keywords-8662">"Circular" saw</term>, which I wished to see at Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7928">Phillipps</persName>, but was not permitted to, since he was not on site, I had greater success with my enquiries than I had dared to hope. — First, I saw the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1856" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-14" n="41" cert="0">factory</placeName> where the beautiful tableware called <term ref="gfa-keywords-9308">"Britannia Metal"</term> " is made. It is almost like silver in appearance, but, incidentally, soft as tin. The items processed there are mostly oval and round tea, milk and coffee pots, <pb n="78" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557819"/> as well as various other table utensils. — Just as the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8706"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9117">tinsmith</term></term> casts everything, so here, with the exception of the spoons, which, like the letters in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8534">type foundries</term>, are cast with great agility in <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metal</term> moulds, the metal is rolled out in <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheets</term> of various thickness, then cut out in the required contours and placed under the stamping press. A description of the production of an oval tea pot with a round spout and hollow neck will suffice, as this is the most difficult and complex of all the pieces to process. — After the sheet is cut out to the proper size and shape, (as the teapot and any other hollow vessel is made up of two halves) it is placed under the stamping presses, where it is completely formed by the falling tamping block, in <pb n="79" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557820"/> various stages that gradually become deeper and deeper, so that no wrinkles occur — which would otherwise happen if it were formed into the desired shape all at once. After their edges have been somewhat filed, the two halves are placed about two lines above each other to overlap on the long side. Then, the joint is held at a distance to the wide, but not strongly blowing, flame of a soldering tube. As soon as the piece is sufficiently heated by its proximity to the flame, something the worker knows well enough from extensive practice, he lays a thin strip of fast melting <term ref="gfa-keywords-9311">Darcet's or Rose's metal</term> over the joint and everything is instantly fused together, hence solidly soldered. — The cylinder and base, the rim on which the lid rests, the hinges and mountings or ornaments, which are previously formed in presses or under engraving <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">rollers</term>, <pb n="80" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557821"/> are fastened in the same way by soldering. When everything is soldered together, the joints or soldered areas are scraped completely smooth, then finally polished by women, first with something sharper and then with extremely fine and mild <term ref="gfa-keywords-2974">sand</term> from the River <placeName ref="gfa-places-2068" cert="0">Tweed</placeName>, giving it a fine, light shine that does not show streaks. — I decided not to inquire about the composition of this <term ref="gfa-keywords-9308">Britannia metal</term>, which in any case could be approximated through chemical analysis. I say approximated, knowing from experience that even skilful <term ref="gfa-keywords-8917">chemists</term> have yet to discover, neither in proportion, nor even in material, those components of my steel alloys, which I was certain to have taken. From the price, however, I thought I could quite safely deduce the content of the material in general, and since I was told that <pb n="81" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557822"/> the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pound</term> came to 16 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8463">Pence</term> or 45 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8444">Kreuzer</term>, I was convinced that in addition to pure English <term ref="gfa-keywords-8706">tin</term>, along with perhaps a little <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term>, more economical additives, such as <term ref="gfa-keywords-9636">zinc</term>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9464">antimony</term>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9249">king</term>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9625">wismuth</term>, perhaps also <term ref="gfa-keywords-8910">cadmium</term>, if it could be produced in quantity, constitute the integral parts of this Britannia metal. — A metal known as "Turkannan" is still used for similar equipment in other manufactories, though it appears more different in name than in nature.</p>

                <p>From this manufactory, I went to a <placeName ref="gfa-places-1857" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-14" n="42" cert="0">warehouse</placeName>, where they have <term ref="gfa-keywords-9655">drawn iron</term> for all types of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8994"><term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel wire</term></term>, as well as some with semi-circular, triangular and square perforations. —  The manufacturer himself came to the warehouse as requested, and since I expressed doubts as to whether these irons would also be strong <pb n="82" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557823"/> enough for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8482">cast steel wire</term>, he proclaimed that I need only accompany him to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2093" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-14" n="43" cert="0">“Factory”</placeName> a few doors down, where he would demonstrate just how well they perform. This factory is, like most in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, behind the houses facing the street, through which one must pass via a narrow corridor, into a kind of courtyard. Here, there were a number of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9439">workshops for blacksmiths</term>, filers, turners, as well as the wire drawing mill, because this is also the place where <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">rollers</term> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9326">coins</term>, stamping presses, entire <term ref="gfa-keywords-9643">lathes</term> and, in general, all kinds of machines are made from processed iron and steel. For me, the most important thing was the <term ref="gfa-keywords-633">wire drawing</term>. I saw round drawn bars of cast steel 12 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> long and ¾ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inch</term> thick, all the way down to one <term ref="gfa-keywords-8541">line</term>. The thinner dimensions, that is, from 4 lines and down, are all polished. However, there were also defective and broken <pb n="83" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557824"/> pieces, and after inspecting everything sufficiently, I was convinced that my equipment for round steel, in comparison to this one, is probably the best known and available in this respect to date. The factory owner (I am very much mistaken if he is not a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8565">Quaker</term>) was so pleased with me that he gave me two more pieces of cast steel wire, each a foot long, which I wanted to take along as samples, and he refused to accept any payment at all. — I made a number of interesting observations regarding the rollers for cast steel, which he makes with full-length iron axles, also regarding their <term ref="gfa-keywords-8561">hardness</term> and especially the way they are turned with mathematical precision as they are harden and, finally, with regard to the hardening of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9330">coin punches</term> to prevent them from cracking. I was amazed to see the very same result, which was contrary to the theory and which I had achieved myself shortly before my departure to <pb n="84" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557825"/> <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> in similar hardening experiments with my own <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term>.</p>
                <p>I was astonished by a display of the impudence of thieves in England. In a newly constructed building, which adjoins the others, we went from one room, in which finished <term ref="gfa-keywords-9643">lathes</term>
                    are for sale, to another, where smaller manufactured goods are stored in glass cabinets. The lock on the door between the two rooms had been broken off, so that it was just hanging by a screw. Only the night before, thieves, having heard about the stock there, climbed over the roofs of neighbouring houses and into the courtyard carrying ladders, climbed through the windows, loosened a pane to open one of them, and then, with prying tools, forced open the door to the other room. A dog in the courtyard made such a terrible racket that the neighbours <pb n="85" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557826"/> in the surrounding area woke up, and the thieves, leaving their stash behind, fled by the same route from whence they had come.</p>
                <p>It appears as if the <placeName ref="gfa-places-145">South American</placeName> government intends to mint its coins properly, for the factory owner told me, among other things, that yesterday a gentleman ordered ten <term ref="gfa-keywords-9245">rolling mills</term> and their frames, which are to be ready in four months, as well as four <term ref="gfa-keywords-9328">minting presses</term>. In general, I heard from various sources about the increased demand for English products on the other side of the southern <placeName ref="gfa-places-2156">Atlantic</placeName>, and repeated praise of the government's policy, which is opening up new avenues for their <term ref="gfa-keywords-3246">industry</term> and activities.</p>

                <p>Before<note>In der Druckausgabe war dieser Abschnitt nicht durch Einrückung gekennzeichnet.</note> lunch, which I was invited to take at my <placeName ref="gfa-places-1859" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7860">friend's country estate</persName></placeName>, about four <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> from <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, I had an important errand to make, namely to visit the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1858" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-14" n="44" cert="0">“malleable Iron <pb n="86" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557827"/> factory”</placeName>, where they make the <term ref="gfa-keywords-56">soft cast iron</term>, and so I took leave of my fellow craftsman, whose company, if such things can be measured on a pecuniary scale, was dearer to me than fifty <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>. It is almost unbelievable, if one has not seen it with his owns eyes, what quantity of objects the <term ref="gfa-keywords-55">soft iron foundry</term> has gradually taken over and drawn into its circle. I bought more than fifty articles related to <term ref="gfa-keywords-9434">locksmithing</term>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9793">gunsmithing</term> and other trades. The simplicity of casting, the pliability, durability and flexibility of the material itself, which belies all theories about the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8980">ductility</term> of metals, and the purity, shine and strength of the material when filed, polished and employed, account for the great demand for it, not to mention the affordability of many products in the gunsmithing trade, especially <term ref="gfa-keywords-8907">service rifles</term>, <pb n="87" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557828"/> as well as in blade making, locksmithing, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9102">quincaillerie</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9103">plating</term>. Both associates were there when I arrived at the factory, but one was obliged to leave on account of business. — The other, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8018" type="met">Cardell</persName>, from his accent probably a <placeName ref="gfa-places-1019">Scot</placeName>, was a friendly young man who had not long ago arrived from that country. His questions, whether I might give him models for casting, how these must be made, and why they are not made in all foundries, gave me very clear insight into the nature of the process, filling in the gaps and removing any doubts that my own experiments with this process had left me.</p>
                <p>With the conviction that I had now achieved my purpose in this matter, especially as I had learned what kind of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> was used ex<pb n="88" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557829" break="no"/>clusively for this product and where it was taken from, I hurriedly left for my <persName ref="gfa-actors-7860">friend's</persName> beautiful <placeName ref="gfa-places-1859" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-14" n="45" cert="0">country estate</placeName>, where, after an enjoyable lunch — or, since we got up from the table at 8 o'clock in the evening, rather the evening meal — and with an invitation to return tomorrow at 9 o'clock in the morning for breakfast to visit a large <placeName ref="gfa-places-1860" cert="0">establishment</placeName> three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> away where kitchen utensils of all kinds are cast of the thinnest iron, then softened, turned, tinned and thoroughly blackened, etc., I turned towards <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham's</placeName> clouds of smoke, through which the sun appeared white and the gradually emerging evening glow dark and beautiful, with the knowledge that I had not made my journey in vain, even if I were to return right then and there.</p>
                <p>A trait of English charlatanry, which in the promotion of its goods and products is more advanced than anywhere else in the world, however “reasonable” the nation <pb n="89" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557830"/> may be otherwise, amused me very much on my way home. As is well known, the English shoe polish, which they call “Japan Blacking”, is beautiful and very good. However, there are many manufacturers of this product, and each of them claims to have the best one. Now, at the window of a store, I saw a big yellow piece of paper with "Marvel!" printed on it in big letters. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7959">“Turners</persName> incomparable blacking” and then below it the bedroom of a gentleman, next to the table a broken mirror, and on the table one of the gentleman's boots, before which he quite casually shaves his face, while the pet cat is very agitated upon seeing its reflection in the other boot that is standing on the floor, taking it for another cat intruding on his territory.</p>

                <head>Faszinierende Eisengiesserei am Kanal, 15. Juni 1825</head>
                <p><placeName ref="gfa-places-20"><date when="1825-06-15">June 15th</date></placeName>. I did not fail <pb n="90" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557831"/> to set out this morning in time to be at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1859" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-15" n="46" cert="0">Smethwik Grove</placeName> at 9 o'clock for breakfast. I could not refrain myself from entering the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1861" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-15" n="47" cert="0">“nuv Coal wharf”</placeName>, as the door had just been opened and I saw from a distance some small <term ref="gfa-keywords-8662">circular saws</term> at work. — I had to convince myself again, as with the tools of this kind installed by Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785">Bodmer</persName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1862">St. Blasien</placeName>, that they, whether small or large, provide an almost unimaginable advantage where they are driven by waterpower. Here, scarcely <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">half-inch-thick</term> boards, which are used to make packing cases and, I assume, packing barrels, were cut and stacked to dry in the open air. One must see it to believe how simple the setup is and how much one man can accomplish with it in a single day.</p>
                <p>After a breakfast that <pb n="91" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557832"/> easily makes one forget eating altogether until 6 o'clock in the evening, we walked in the direction of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1750">Wednesbury</placeName> to the large <placeName ref="gfa-places-1860" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-15" n="48" cert="0">iron foundry</placeName> on the canal. How astonished I was to see over a hundred workers, most of them clothed only up to their belts on account of the intense heat, in an enormous hall, at one end of which two <term ref="gfa-keywords-238">cupola furnaces</term> about 10 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> high and 30 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> wide, each blasted through two <term ref="gfa-keywords-9715">nozzles</term> positioned opposite each other, were in continuous operation. The workers were ceaselessly moulding, pouring, and cleaning the <term ref="gfa-keywords-2974">sand</term> from the hot <term ref="gfa-keywords-9159">casted objects</term> that have just been removed from the flasks, and cutting off or breaking off the sprues, then carrying the casted objects away to be <term ref="gfa-keywords-8803">annealed</term>. How astonished I was, I say, to see this seemingly chaotic hustle and bustle, which was nevertheless regulated by the duty of each worker in carrying out his task. Here, in this factory such things are produced as <term ref="gfa-keywords-9253">kitchen utensils</term> of all kinds, ornaments, and even <term ref="gfa-keywords-9795">nails</term> just one inch long, <pb n="92" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557833"/> which are annealed and sold by the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pound</term> for 7 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8444">kr.</term> of our money, or 5 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">Pf.</term> for a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shilling</term>. I feel compelled to describe in greater detail the process by which these things are manufactured, by which a thousand pieces are formed and cast, each time without defects. Those who are familiar ex professo with the process of making moulds for casting know that scraping the flasks and removing the models from the sand can sometimes entail breaking it free, which, in the case of so insignificant and small an object as a nail, should never be the case.</p>
                <p>Half of the metal nail models are therefore stereotyped or in bas relief, with the heads attached to small sprue channels, which are located on a plate connected to the middle main casting pipe and form a whole with it. In the centre are four holes into which the <pb n="93" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557834"/> four pins of the half flask fit exactly. Before the flask is placed, everything is carefully brushed off, then light coal dust is applied and the flask is formed and lifted off, where, because the nails form a whole with the plate, the half nails extend above it with one corner protruding, the heads are pointed obliquely upwards, and the casting and connecting ducts are also oblique, so as to prevent breaking. Thus, one of the flask halves is formed, then round, turned pins are inserted into the holes of the plates, which correspond to the holes in the other flask halves, and these are also formed, and then everything is assembled for casting. — I also note that all the flasks are made of strong <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term>. The models of kitchen utensils, which are often formed in complicated flasks, i.e. ones that are stacked vertically and then cut again <pb n="94" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557835"/> into two vertical halves, are all made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term>, very stiffly hammered, and often cut into several pieces, usually ¾ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8541">line</term> thick. — The iron, of which they melt in one hour up to 12 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term> and more, which is only possible with such a strong blast and dense cokes, is very grey <term ref="gfa-keywords-9011"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1330">Staffordshire Pigiron</placeName></term>, which remains fine-grained grey even after remelting, if it is not poured too thin and cooled down too fast. — As a precaution, however, everything is taken to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9656">“softening” or “annealing furnaces”</term>, packed into large <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast-iron</term> Cylinder, which are 5 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> high and 2 feet wide, and of which six stand in a furnace, and furnished with the proper cement powder. After twenty-four hours, one is assured of perfectly <term ref="gfa-keywords-56">soft iron</term> for turning, filing and drilling. In some pieces, the nails undergo <pb n="95" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557836"/> a special treatment. From the cement pots, the tableware is taken to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-2887">lathes</term>, where turning is a very easy task owing to the smoothness of the casting and the fact that the sand is so pure that the tableware often appears silvery-white underneath. From the lathes, the tableware is taken to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9434">metal workshops</term>, where the necessary holes are drilled and the handles and knobs are fitted, and then to the tinning workshops. This <term ref="gfa-keywords-8641">tinning</term> of cast iron is still the best I have ever seen; extremely economical in terms of flux and fire, no danger at all of burning the hands, since the tinning material is held by specially made tongs, and very solid and beautiful. — Just as <term ref="gfa-keywords-9261">coppersmiths</term> do, when the bottom of the dishes has reached its full lustre, it is rinsed in cold water to pre<pb n="96" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557837" break="no"/>vent pooling. — — After tinning, the dishes are coated with coal tar to prevent rusting and to give them a beautiful, glazed appearance. They are then dried at a temperature at which the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8706">tin</term> no longer melts, covered with lids made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8638">tinplate</term>, and packaged for shipment.</p>
                <p>I note too that on all the dishes the liquid measure, or the number of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9366">pints</term> they hold, is very legibly cast, which is quite convenient for some uses.</p>

            <div type="day">
                <head>Bekanntschaft mit Henry Adcock, 15. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>On our way back to <placeName ref="gfa-places-20" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-15" n="49">Birmingham</placeName>, we stopped at Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7733" type="met">Adcoke's</persName>, who has a <placeName ref="gfa-places-1863" type="itienrar" when="1825-06-15" n="50" cert="0"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9602"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9532">stamping, gilding, and jeweller’s factory</term></term></placeName> (the oldest in Birmingham), since my friend believed that he might be keenly interested in the new <term ref="gfa-keywords-9528">silver-like metal</term> that I had produced only the day before my departure for <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, after a number of previous experiments, in a very particular way that was different from all my pre<pb n="97" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557838" break="no"/>previous compositions and, by all appearances, warranted equally favourable judgment.</p>
                <p>It was indeed so, and we agreed on the following morning to investigate the matter more closely. — Having read an inscription on a <placeName ref="gfa-places-2092" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-15" n="51" cert="0">place</placeName> in Birmingham saying, “Original Inventor of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-56">malleable Iron</term> Grove”, I was eager to meet this curious man, so I ventured in to see him. — As soon as I saw him and heard him speak, I thought: Is it possible? Have all your physiognomic knowledge and general powers of estimation deceived you? My misgivings were compounded by the condition of the premises, the lack of stock in the warehouse, and even the seemingly inferior quality of the merchandise itself, <pb n="98" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557839"/> of which I purchased a few items. He assured me that he was, indeed, the first inventor and that his work was only poorly imitated by others. — Incidentally, he was (unnecessarily so) much more reserved than the good <persName ref="gfa-actors-8018" type="met">Scotsman</persName> I had encountered the day before.</p>
                <p>At lunch, which I enjoyed once more with Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7733" type="met">Adcok</persName>, who was also invited, at my <persName ref="gfa-actors-7860"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1859" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-15" n="52" cert="0">friend's country house</placeName></persName>, I learned that there was no truth to the man's pretensions, but that the <term ref="gfa-keywords-56">soft iron</term> had been invented by another, far more ingenious man, who had even cast both useful and very good <term ref="gfa-keywords-9336">sewing needles</term> and was generally known by the name of <persName ref="gfa-actors-7903">Millman</persName>. This almost unbelievable circumstance, though I do not doubt it given the respectability of the person from whom I have it, becomes more believable knowing that people now have the capacity themselves to cast <pb n="99" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557840"/> in <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metal</term> an inscription written on <term ref="gfa-keywords-5503">paper</term> directly from the paper, thus using the cast plates as printing plates to obtain a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9034">facsimile</term>.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="day">
                <head>Zusammenarbeit mit Henry Adcock, 16. Juni 1825</head>
                <p> <date when="1825-06-16">June 16th</date>. In the morning after 9 o'clock I went <placeName ref="gfa-places-1863" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-16" n="53" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7733">to Mr. Adcok</persName></placeName>. As I had brought with me only small <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheets</term> of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9474"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9528">my metal</term></term>, already rolled out very thinly, he asked if they could be melted down to make a larger piece. I assumed that in a factory like his that produces so many metal products, it would be easy to do anything. Yet, there was nothing there to work with. No <term ref="gfa-keywords-8636">crucible</term>, no <term ref="gfa-keywords-2908">melting furnace</term>. There was nothing but a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9658">forge</term> with a small bellows. I could not even find refractory bricks. All the same, it had to be done.</p>
                <p>I had some crucibles delivered from the store. For want of anything better, I used ordinary bricks and got to work <pb n="100" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557841"/> with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">cokes</term>, which I had never used for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8696">melting</term> before in my life. — The work went quite well, once I saw that it was only a matter of taking enough time to do it. I obtained a nicely engraved rosette for myself made from the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9249">regulus</term>, which he had forged and laminated. On this occasion, I saw the method, little known on the mainland, that is, at least with this ease and without the slightest degradation of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8342">mother stamp</term>, how to make very precise and clean impressions of the engraved <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term>, regardless of how deep or large it may be, and to transfer them to other steel, so as to multiply the stamps at will. — This is something most certainly worthy of mention for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9329">mints</term>, knowing the problems that have occurred in some of them. He also promised to make me another ring from this metal, which I call <term ref="gfa-keywords-9528">“Silveretto”</term>. <pb n="101" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557842"/> The ring will be set with a stone of hyacinth colour and immense transparency, which I obtained as <term ref="gfa-keywords-336">slag</term> when I recently reduced <term ref="gfa-keywords-8895">manganese dioxide</term> to metal and gave to him for this purpose.</p>
                <p>This <placeName ref="gfa-places-1863" cert="0">factory</placeName> makes very beautiful things of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9108">gold</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8982">precious stones</term>, as well as a lot of gold-plated things, at very reasonable prices, it seemed to me. I cannot help but mention a most curious fact, since we were talking about gilding. There were years in the beginning of the war, he said, when we needed 20,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds</term> worth of gold for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9602">gilding</term>, which is about 230,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">Gulden</term> of Reichsgeld. My own consumption, he added, amounted to 230 to 210 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">fl.</term> per week. This has now been greatly reduced, in part because buttons are no longer as popular as they used to be, and in part because we now, using the new <pb n="102" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557843"/> method, only require an eighth of the gold we once did.</p>
                <p>After a splendid lunch, at which I was obliged, however, as elsewhere, to eat the salad with the cheese after dessert, which was then followed by <term ref="gfa-keywords-9618">wine</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9370">bitter oranges</term>, the two very beautiful daughters of Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7733">Adcok</persName> regaled us with <term ref="gfa-keywords-3909">music</term> on the piano accompanied by their singing. The unpretentious and informal manner in which this was done gave their skill an even superior value in my eyes, and after the performance of a <placeName ref="gfa-places-1019">Scottish</placeName> ballad and a <placeName ref="gfa-places-138">Spanish</placeName> romance, I considered it a kind of compliment for people of German tongue that the finale consisted of several arias from the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9863">Freischütz</term>.</p>
                <p>My new acquaintance, who had become very valuable to me, accompanied me from his <pb n="103" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557844"/> <placeName ref="gfa-places-2094" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-16" n="54" cert="0">home</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1864" cert="0">Summer Hill</placeName>, which place, a good <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">mile</term> from <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, rightly bears this name, to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1867" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-16" n="55" cert="0">Russian sledging hill</placeName>, a foreign venue where the Birmingham public enjoys itself in the evenings, especially the ladies, who seem to be particularly fond of equestrian pursuits. For not only do you often find them of different ages and statuses riding alone in the lightweight <term ref="gfa-keywords-9122">“Gigs”</term>, but also riding overland on their “Poneys” (small horses). He bade me farewell with a "God bless You", which is so important in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> and which I returned with equal cordiality. On my way home, I bought some of the beautiful <term ref="gfa-keywords-9299">"Rules"</term> they make in Birmingham, wrote a letter <persName ref="gfa-actors-6139"><placeName ref="gfa-places-131">home</placeName></persName>, and packed up my belongings to continue my journey the following day.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="day">
                <head>Birmingham–Manchester, 17. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <date when="1825-06-17">17th</date>. To my chagrin, I could <pb n="104" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557845"/> only find a seat on the inside of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9277">coach</term> until the first stop at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1765" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-17" n="56">Wolverhampton</placeName>, 14 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> from <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>. At the second stop from Wolverhampton to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1868" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-17" n="57">Stafford</placeName>, which is 16 miles, I had to move nolens volens to the outside. I saved three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shillings</term>, , to be sure, but that served me no purpose. Moreover, there were 7 passengers outside in the back, 5 inside the coach and 6 in the front, that is, two passengers more than the license permitted, for which the coachman could have been prosecuted. In spite of all the misery of the indescribable dust, the cramped seating and the frequent worry of overturning, I was comforted and distracted by the sight of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-6116">coal mines</term>, often close to the road with their <term ref="gfa-keywords-8939">horse and steam carriages</term>, the many <term ref="gfa-keywords-9005">ironworks</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-2908">smelting furnaces</term>, the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9124">glassworks</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9038">faience factories</term>, and everything else that causes smoke and fire and makes this region certainly <pb n="105" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557846"/> the only one of its kind in the world. I was equally intrigued by the new way of cutting stones for the construction of roads, as <persName ref="gfa-actors-7892">Mac Adam's</persName> method uses only sharp-edged stones rather than round ones. There are two different methods, both of which aim to accomplish more with less effort than the usual method, where the worker stood upright while reducing the material and his distance from the object and the inconvenient position caused many a stroke to be made in vain. The first and simplest method is that the worker sits on a ring of straw on the ground, with a large flat stone in front of him, on which another ring of straw is placed, within which he strikes the stones with great certainty and force, guiding the short hammer with both hands, as the ring prevents them from moving about. The second, perfected, method <pb n="106" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557847"/> is that the worker has in front of him a pole about 2 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> high, the top of which is covered with a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> plate. He himself sits before it on a three-legged chair. To his right is a wooden trough, 1 foot wide and 6 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> high, which ends with its opening onto the pole. The trough rests on two supports at the end, which are attached to it with rings, and is rather rigid, so that the stones tend to fall onto the pole by themselves. In his left hand, he holds a round not very thick rod of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term>, which ends in a round ring about 2½ inches in diameter. Under this ring, he takes all the stones and strikes the rod with only one hand and an even shorter hammer. Not a single stroke misses and, because the ring also serves as a measure, I have never seen a pile of stones as uniform as this.</p>
                <p>As the time allotted to me for this journey is very sparse, <pb n="107" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557848"/> I left <placeName ref="gfa-places-1761">New Etruria</placeName> and its esteemed proprietor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7568">Wedgewood</persName> without a visit on this occasion.</p>
                <p>Looking at <placeName ref="gfa-places-471" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-17" n="58">Manchester</placeName> from a distance, I could already see how it had grown in size in the last eleven years, and as I entered it seemed to me far more populous than <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>. Since it was almost nine o'clock in the evening, not only were the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8533">gaslights</term> burning everywhere, but, to my particular enjoyment, the clock face on the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2232" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-17" n="58.1">Infirmary</placeName> was shining in its own peculiar glow. It is attached to the frontispiece of the houses and is made entirely of frosted <term ref="gfa-keywords-9861">glass</term>. On the outside are two very neatly decorated rings, or circles, of cast iron, between which are the numbers, painted black as are the circles, ornaments and hands. During the day, it looks quite like an ordinary clock face, but at night, when there is gas light behind it, <pb n="108" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557849"/> it is a beautiful transparency on which one can see the hour and minute of the time from a distance.</p>

                <head>Bei Johann Georg Bodmer und William Fairbairn, 18. Juni 1825</head>
                <p> <date when="1825-06-18">June 18th</date>. Shortly after nine o'clock in the morning, I went to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1869" cert="0">Oxford road</placeName> to look for <placeName ref="gfa-places-1870" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-18" n="59" cert="0">building No. 50</placeName>, where I hoped to meet or inquire about a <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785">dear compatriot</persName> and, generally, a number of friends and acquaintances from <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName>. I had difficulty finding the address in this street, which is almost a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">mile</term> long. As the business day had already begun, however, I did not encounter any of them. Also <placeName ref="gfa-places-2079" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-18" n="60" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7607">Mr. Li</persName></placeName>, who I so looked forward to seeing again, was absent from <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName> altogether.</p>
                <p>That evening, I had the pleasure of finding Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785" type="met">Georg Bodmer</persName> in his <placeName ref="gfa-places-1870" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-18" n="61" cert="0">lodgings</placeName>. This skilled mechanic, so experienced with <term ref="gfa-keywords-9466">spinning mills</term>, is likely lost to Switzerland and the country <pb n="109" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557850"/> he served with unimpeachable integrity, as he is given greater freedom for his work in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> and better rewards for his industry. — Still, it is especially pleasing that he has kept enough patriotic feeling as to allow young promising Swiss, four of whom I met at his premises, to enter his workshop, to share his plans with them, and to supervise their designs and drawings. We also visited Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-6319"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-7612"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1718" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-18" n="62">Fairbairn</placeName></orgName></persName>, who is certainly one of the earliest and most skilled “Millwrights” in England. One must understand by this designation, however, something quite different than we do, since in <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName> and <placeName ref="gfa-places-35">Germany</placeName> they work almost exclusively in <term ref="gfa-keywords-544">wood</term>. — In England, <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> is more common than wood, and just this afternoon, in the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7612"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1718">workshops</placeName></orgName>, where I was, over 120, about one <pb n="110" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557851"/> hundred and twenty <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term>, of various large and small objects were cast using two <term ref="gfa-keywords-238">cupola furnaces</term>. — These furnaces, which are now almost universally used instead of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8480">reverberatory furnaces</term> for their simplicity in design and fuel economy, are made of strong <term ref="gfa-keywords-8993">sheet iron</term> that is riveted together, round, sometimes rectangular, 10 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> high, 22 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> wide on the inside, and 7½ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> high from bottom to top. The <term ref="gfa-keywords-8797">furnace shaft</term> is made of refractory <term ref="gfa-keywords-2974">Sand</term> and can withstand about one week's use. If the furnace is new, well heated, and the blast strong enough, blowing through two <term ref="gfa-keywords-9715">nozzles</term> positioned across from each other, which can be raised higher than is usual from the bottom as needed when there is a large amount of metal in the furnace, it is possible to achieve incredible results, namely, to process or remelt up to 20 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term> in one hour, just as it is then <pb n="111" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557852"/> possible to swell up to 50 centner in the furnace and maintain its liquidity. Only the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">cokes</term> that give off such immense heat and are almost indestructible, together with the appropriate additive which they supplement to the iron, make this feasible.</p>

Understandably, we spoke a great deal about <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">our fatherland</placeName>, chiefly about the nature of its <term ref="gfa-keywords-3246">industry</term> and the differences between it in the various cantons. I could not refrain from remarking that in many places, especially in <placeName ref="gfa-places-131">my own hometown</placeName>, there remains a lack of cohesion and unity among the affluent, industrious and knowledgeable among us to bring about <pb n="112" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557853"/> anything useful for our society as a whole. The <emph rend="italic">Vis unita fortior</emph><note>Lat. für «Vereinigung ist Stärke».</note> appears to be entirely misunderstood. What a contrast <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> is to us! In this country, which has a long history of prosperity and steadily increasing wealth, seldom does anyone stand alone. Far more often, entire societies are formed to carry out new ventures.</p>

                <head>Besuch der Fabrik Sharp Hill &amp; Comp., 20. Juni 1825</head>
                <p> <placeName ref="gfa-places-471"><date when="1825-06-20">June 20th</date></placeName>. This morning, by invitation, I visited the <persName ref="gfa-actors-8031"><persName ref="gfa-actors-8320"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8319"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1871" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-20" n="64">factory of Messrs. Sharp Hill &amp; Comp.</placeName></orgName></persName></persName>, which is by no means open to the public, where, among many other things, <term ref="gfa-keywords-3009">“Power looms”</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9357">“Patent Reeds”</term> for weavers are made. Having been introduced by Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785">Bodmer</persName>, who is himself working at this factory, I was received in a very friendly manner not only by the engineer, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7939" type="met">Roberts</persName>, who is a very skilled me<pb n="113" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557854" break="no"/>chanic, but also by one of the associates present, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8031" type="met">Hill</persName>. — As Mr. Bodmer was obliged to leave, Mr. Roberts guided me around everywhere himself. As a novelty, I witnessed the use of a (quadruple) <term ref="gfa-keywords-9441">Archimedes screw</term>, which is continuously rotated by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term> in the water reservoir in which it is located, and where the incoming water constantly drives the air in the empty screws in front of it, then feeds it through a series of pipes to the two <term ref="gfa-keywords-238">cupola furnaces</term>. The blasts were very uniform here, according to the experienced workers, too uniform for melting with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">coke</term>, whereas last Saturday the smelter <placeName ref="gfa-places-1718"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-7612"><persName ref="gfa-actors-6319">at Mr. Fairbairn's</persName></orgName></placeName>, where the furnaces are also blown by means of an Archimedes screw, lamented that the blasts were too variable. — The ovens, incidentally, were similar in sha<pb n="114" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557855" break="no"/>pe and size to those I had seen elsewhere. — In addition to the drilling and wheel cutting machine, which is very similar to that of Mr. <orgName ref="gfa-actors-578"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1873"><persName ref="gfa-actors-8032">Japy in Beaucourt</persName></placeName></orgName>, I observed only in passing the gigantic <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> <term ref="gfa-keywords-9643">lathes</term> (resting on a very firm foundation with spindles equipped with replaceable gears for the various speeds required, and on which cast <term ref="gfa-keywords-8644">"Shafts"</term> and other large objects weighing 50, 60 and more <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term> are rotated with ease, as if of <term ref="gfa-keywords-544">wood</term>) on my way to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-3009">“Power looms”</term>, on which the weaving was really done. From there, we proceeded to the most extraordinary <term ref="gfa-keywords-9357">“Reed”</term> machines. — The “Power looms” are not only very beautifully made (the frames, instead of being, as formerly, of wood, now entirely of iron and, in addition to being per<pb n="115" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557856" break="no"/>fectly solid, very elegant) but also in some cases of uncommon width, so that, with a kind of device à la <persName ref="gfa-actors-7869">Jaquard</persName> for weaving figures into the fabric, they can also be used with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8822">wool</term> to make foot rugs or so-called “Caspets”.</p>
                <p>The reed machine invented by Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7939">Roberts</persName> seemed to me most remarkable and demonstrated just how far we have come in the application of mechanical principles and hand movements. Not even a drawing, unless it were varied in perspective with every detail indicated, would be sufficient to understand it, much less a mere description. I therefore content myself only to relay its effect, as Mr. Roberts himself reported to me.</p>
                <p>The split rods or canes, spaced at a proper distance from each other, <pb n="116" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557857"/> are placed in short, vertical, filtering <term ref="gfa-keywords-9306">brass</term> cylinders, through which they pass, according to the dimensions of the teeth or steel wire, which the machine pushes from a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">roller</term>, on which they are wound as long thin steel strips, through a coulisse or groove, and cut to the required length. At the same time, the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8928">colophony-coated</term> cords, which are wound on two spools and kept soft by nearby lamps, fasten the inserted and cut wires by binding or spinning them around the rods. The reeds are then removed as desired, while the machine is turned off momentarily, and cut off at the intervals of the teeth, wires, or "Dents", as they are called in English. There are two such machines in operation. <pb n="117" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557858"/> Each one operates double, that is, two reeds are made at once. For each reed there is a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9213">boy</term> to supervise and attend to it, and when I state that by this supervision and attendance the machine cuts, threads and fastens 165,000 such dents daily per boy, and all this in the highest degree of mastery, those who have any conception of this work when done by human hands will be best able to appreciate the ingenuity and productivity of this machine. In addition to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-3009">power looms</term> mentioned above, of which eighty are completed weekly in this factory, notwithstanding the many subsidiary operations, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7939">Roberts</persName> has also invented and executed a very simplified <term ref="gfa-keywords-9661">Jacquard loom</term>, which <pb n="118" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557859"/> can also be operated by steam or waterpower, on which a piece of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9452">silk</term> cloth with very delicate figures has been woven.</p>

                <head>Besuch der St. Georges Foundry, 20. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>I would have liked to see the vertical <term ref="gfa-keywords-8852">boring machine</term> with which the cylinders of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term> are bored, as I disliked the horizontal one introduced by <persName ref="gfa-actors-7572"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1723">Mr. Watt in Soho</placeName></persName> — The same one is in Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7921"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8331"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1874" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-20" n="65" cert="0">Richard Ormrod's iron foundry</placeName></orgName></persName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1875" cert="0">Minshull Street</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1876" cert="0">London-Road</placeName>. The young Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7826" type="met">Escher</persName> of <placeName ref="gfa-places-154">Zurich</placeName>, son of my friend, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7525">Escher</persName> in <orgName ref="gfa-actors-1081"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1939" cert="0">Neumühle</placeName></orgName>, who was so commendable for his contributions to our patriotic <term ref="gfa-keywords-3246">industry</term>, was kind enough to take me there, as he was personally known to Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7921">Ormrod</persName>. Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7826">Escher</persName>, whose knowledge of the language and the country, but above all whose manifold scientific knowledge, warrants great expectations, took me to the office to obtain permission <pb n="119" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557860"/> to visit the factory, which the attending supervisor granted, since he knew Mr. Escher, who had already commissioned work there. We had not been in the drilling workshop long, where they were working on a steam cylinder, when Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7921" type="met">Ormrod</persName> himself, who had apparently heard that foreigner visitors were present, entered. — His expression was rather unfriendly, and when Mr. Escher explained that we had asked permission, he replied: "We do not like to show our workshop to foreigners. However, since you know this gentleman, you may show him around if you wish". He remained with us, and in a short time became so friendly that Mr. Escher, who was obliged to go somewhere at four o'clock, was able to take his leave, as Mr. Ormrod took it upon himself to show me around.</p>
                <p>He complained profusely, as this is the case <pb n="120" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557861"/> in all factories, and of which I have already seen evidence in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, how difficult it is to have and treat the workers, and I really believe that many who come from the mainland would now obtain employment in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, which they would otherwise never have obtained. Because Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7921">Ormrod</persName> gave me a list of his products when he left, of which I provide only an excerpt here, so that one can get an idea of the significance of such a factory, in which individual pieces, such as <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term>, are worth 30,000 to 80,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">fl.</term> of our money, and of which several have been started and some will soon be completed, I will focus on what is new or worth noting, without mentioning what is common to others.</p>
                <p>I particularly admired the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8852">boring machine</term>. The cylinder does not descend from above, as with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8717">can<pb n="121" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557862" break="no"/>ons</term>, which used to be bored vertically, but is bolted with screws onto a bricked foundation, which has a hole in the middle and is lined with metal boxes, in which the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9155">boring bars</term> rotate below.</p>
                <p>At the top, where the boring bar returns to the box, there is a large <term ref="gfa-keywords-9477">spur wheel</term>, n which a small, long drive engages — which is fitted to the boring bar, which is a cylinder of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> with its inlaid cutters or knives of a somewhat smaller diameter than the cylinder itself, and which conveys the speed required for drilling the cast iron, and thus the borer descends gradually into the cylinder, where, since three points of the borer are in a straight and immovable line, <pb n="122" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557863"/> one can count on its perfectly round and straight inner formation.</p>
                <p><term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">Rollers</term> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8610">"Calico Printers"</term> are also made here in a special (patented) way. They are usually cast from <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metal</term> over an <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> rod or hollow. — Here, they are made entirely of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term>, and if they are not hollow, they have an iron core at the centre. If they are hollow, the round, turned mandrel is removed afterwards, but instead of being lathed, they are pulled through <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term> rings, which are gradually reduced in size, like the tubes of a telescope, by means of a tremendously strong traction, which gives them perfect roundness and polish.</p>
                <p>The <term ref="gfa-keywords-8649">forming</term> of the cylinders for the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term> intrigued me as well. — The mantle is built upright from bricks that are bonded with glue, <pb n="123" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557864"/> and inside coated with adhesive and shaped with a movable rail or rib, like bells. The core is also formed standing, also with the rail or rib, and then everything is dried and fired in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9584">drying stoves</term>, as these pieces require rather <term ref="gfa-keywords-56">durable and pliable cast iron</term>. Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7921">Ormrod</persName> has five <term ref="gfa-keywords-238">cupola furnaces</term>, which — I think only to save space, which in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> is exceedingly precious — are blasted by two horizontal <term ref="gfa-keywords-8933">blowing cylinders</term> and supply enough iron for large pieces, assuming they hold close to 200 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term>. — English <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> generally remains liquid for an exceptionally long time, which makes their work much easier. — As with the copper cylinders described above, the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8775">lead</term> pipes are also drawn over steel mandrels and through similar rings, by means of which me<pb n="124" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557865" break="no"/>chanism a thick and short cast pipe, with a small hole, can be extended to a great length and made as thin as desired. — I saw another curious application of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9380">hydraulic press</term>. The canal that goes through <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName> cuts through the territory on which <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8331"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1874" cert="0">Mr. Ormrod's factories</placeName></orgName> are located, so that one must cross a new bridge of 38 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> in length to get from one side to the other. — As boats often travel on the canal, the bridge presents an obstacle. However, when a boat approaches from a distance, the bridge is raised from the middle on both sides by a single operator by means of a transmission that runs along the bottom of the canal to the other side and then lowered again when the boat has passed, all by means of the machine mentioned above.</p>
                <p>The <term ref="gfa-keywords-3009">machine looms</term>, which are <pb n="125" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557866"/> also frequently made here, warrant no special mention, since they are no more advanced than the any other. From the following models of various types and sizes, objects are cast and finished in iron and metal. Namely, tambours with their arms and rings, horizontal and vertical <term ref="gfa-keywords-8644">shafts</term>, “coupling-boxes”, all kinds of mill and machine wheels; a quantity of lattice work based on the most beautiful drawings; <term ref="gfa-keywords-169">railroads</term> for coal works, salt cart wheels, boat ovens, weighing machines and cast iron pipes; <term ref="gfa-keywords-8941">steam heating</term> devices for factories according to the best principles; all sizes of metal cocks; cylinders for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8610">Calico printers</term>; <term ref="gfa-keywords-9061">gas apparatus</term> of the finest kind; <term ref="gfa-keywords-9356">hydromechanical patent presses</term> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8846">bleachers</term> and paper manufacturers, etc.; <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term> of all types and sizes; steam boilers of for<pb n="126" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557867" break="no"/>ged iron; <term ref="gfa-keywords-8813">printing presses</term> of the most perfect design for one, two, three and four colours; drying machines of the best kind; patented sheet metal tubing of all sizes; <term ref="gfa-keywords-3009">machine weaving looms</term>, etc.</p>
                <p>One judges now by such a business and by the amount of capital it requires. As he led me into the building where he keeps his models, he said, "I challenge anyone in the world to show me the like of them. They cost me <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>, and I keep them, as you see, in a completely fireproof building."</p>

It was a pleasure for me to hear the views on <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> of a young man so suddenly transplanted, yet gifted with a clear mind, who is now working for Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-6319">Fairbairn</persName>, and whose <persName ref="gfa-actors-7525">father</persName>, whom we honour as citizen and statesman alike, has found that a promising son with stonemason's apron (without renouncing proper education) is more honourable than one with a parchment of (often dubious) <term ref="gfa-keywords-9067">genealogy</term>, where no other merits prevail.</p>

                <head>Gedanken zum englischen Geldfluss, 21. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <date when="1825-06-21">21st</date>. In <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, people are very hospitable, and it is strange that this virtue, which dates back to the earliest times <pb n="128" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557869"/> and has thankfully never wholly disappeared, is still evident in the lower north as well as in the upper south.</p>
                <p>I went <placeName ref="gfa-places-2080" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-21" n="67" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-6319">to Mr. Fairbairn's</persName></placeName> for breakfast, to which I had already been invited on Saturday. We enjoyed it. Instead of Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785">Bodmer</persName>, <persName ref="gfa-actors-7826" type="met">young Escher</persName> accompanied me there, amidst much interesting conversation. I perceived something here in his charming <persName ref="gfa-actors-8034" type="met">wife</persName>, which I have often noticed in this country, that people like it when you say what you want, for this is precisely (and it is a subtle feeling) what they would prefer to give you. I could mention several instances of this in various places. It is an equally charming custom to introduce the children to visitors after breakfast or lunch. It has a double benefit: the children grow accustomed to other people, <pb n="129" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557870"/> and an entirely new visitor to this country can discern the character of the children with an analytical gaze. Their character appears natural and unconstrained, and that this is true is evident from the fact that this nation, as a whole, carries within itself that same character.</p>
                <p>After breakfast, we went to Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-6319">Fairbairn's</persName> <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7612"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1718" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-21" n="68">workshops</placeName></orgName>. As many workers as he has, there are not enough of them to fill the orders that have been placed.</p>
                <p>These large orders, these large sums that come into play, and the present amount of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9108">gold</term> are the reason why, in these times of abundance, food and other commodities are proportionately overpriced. Perhaps my old idea about the relative and reciprocal wealth of nations is a ridiculous one. — Each of them wants to be the richest, and everywhere one wants to make a profit.</p>
                <p><pb n="130" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557871"/> — Yet where will this lead, if it should come to the point with some country, as a well-meaning neighbour of <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName> once pronounced at a council meeting of the empire: il faut dépauvrir la Suisse! Fortunately, this wish, as pious as it is wise, has not yet come true. If so, those dear neighbours of ours could certainly have done other than to give us back, for whatever purpose, a part of their superfluous money in order to be able to trade with us. After all, neighbouring nations, in particular, must trade with one another. — Only do not forbid people from spending money. If they have none, they will not spend it, but try, instead, to add to the little they have, which will raise their spirits and their activity, something of which my own country is a striking example. <pb n="131" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557872"/> — If the state's accounts were accurate, we should have run out of money long ago. — In our country, everyone brings to market what he likes, fetches as much as he can for it, while everywhere the door is politely closed in our faces for the products of our industry, and all this notwithstanding, we may not be rich — but neither are we poor — and the sun of <placeName ref="gfa-places-402">Albion</placeName>, behold, it also shines on us. — I was involuntarily led to this digression since, on the one hand, I heard from Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785">Bodmer's</persName> landlady about the price of foodstuffs of all kind (nearly or fully three times as much as ours) and, on the other hand, because the two big questions before England's authorities remain undecided: Export licenses for machines that until now were not allowed to be exported and a very extensive license for the import of foreign art <pb n="132" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557873"/> and natural products. — I was pleased to observe, incidentally, that (<term ref="gfa-keywords-9351">parliament</term> decide as it may) very insightful and influential persons were in favour of this measure.</p>
                <p>The installation for two wire drawing machines, each with sixteen drums, on which the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8994">wire</term> is wound as it emerges from the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9655">drawing die</term>, and all of which are driven by wheels of the same size that maintain movement from the centre, was very interesting to see, for in a very small space, and without any piece interfering with the other, and moreover in a very sturdy and simple manner, all of this was installed. — I also admired the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8662">“portable Circular” saw</term>, and the (albeit very large) <term ref="gfa-keywords-9433">whetstone</term>. Both are driven only by belts, which are connected to the drum (tambour) of a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8644">turning shaft</term>. <pb n="133" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557874"/> If only the speed is fast enough, one can be sure that the driven device does not come to a standstill, though the resistance acting on it is very significant.</p>

                <head>Besuch der Baumwollspinnerei Philips &amp; Lee , 21. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>In the <date when="1825-06-21">evening</date>, I returned to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1782" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-21" n="69"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9466">spinning mill</term></placeName> of Messrs. <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7929"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7607"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7928">Phillips and Lee</persName></persName></orgName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1940">Salford</placeName> to inquire about the arrival of the latter. — Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7928" type="met">Phillips</persName> came to the office himself from another rather distant building, after having heard who was there through the so-called Ear of Dionysius, which I have not seen anywhere other than in the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1941">Rosenburg Castle</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-427">Copenhagen</placeName>. — He was exceedingly friendly, regretted that I had not already inquired after him on Saturday, when Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7607">Lee</persName> was absent, so that I might have spent Sunday with him on <placeName ref="gfa-places-1944" cert="0">his estate</placeName>, and invited me, at once, to visit him on the following day and stay <pb n="134" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557875"/> overnight. — He showed me, as I was eager to see it, their <term ref="gfa-keywords-9061">gas apparatus</term>, which is one of the first and best constructed and largest in <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName>.</p>
                <p>If <placeName ref="gfa-places-2075"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8616">Wigan, or "Kennel Coal"</term></placeName>, can be used to obtain the gas, it is probably the most advantageous. If not, oil is preferred.</p>
                <p>We reached the very large yarn warehouse, built entirely of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> and stone and heated by steam — less dangerous than with air — without climbing any stairs. Instead, the ground suddenly rose, for we stood between four posts that ascended with us and on the level of the floor of the warehouse, where an opening had been made to fit this piece precisely, it stood still, so that the floors together formed a single whole again. We returned in the same manner. <pb n="135" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557876"/> The savings in time for the transport of the goods, as well as the safety of the same, need hardly be mentioned.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="day">
                <head>Bellhouses Sägemühle, 22. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <placeName ref="gfa-places-471"><date when="1825-06-22">22nd</date></placeName>. On a short walk with Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7826">Escher</persName>, we passed this morning by Mr. <placeName ref="gfa-places-1943" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-22" n="70" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7775">Bellhouse's “Saw-Mill”</persName></placeName>. I would have wished, since these machines are so often employed in <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName>, that a dozen owners of such mills from <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">my fatherland</placeName> had been present with me in this place. They would have been convinced by their own experience, especially when one considers that <term ref="gfa-keywords-9414">saw-mills</term> have not existed long in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> at all, and even now are not common, since much is still cut by hand, they would have convinced themselves, I say, how the English spirit of improvement has also prevailed in this area. — The fact that many blades can be inserted into a <pb n="136" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557877"/> frame at the same time is nothing new in our country, though it has not yet been accomplished everywhere. It would be something new, however, if they were to make their blades thinner, but then of course also of good material, and their serrations more practical, as common sense would suggest, and success would confirm. Something new, and very good, would be if they would carefully clean the logs (which here are never round but octagonal, of which four sides are very wide and four, which represent the actual corners, are very narrow) before they are brought onto the carriage or slide of the saw, with a broom that is constantly immersed in water, so that no dirt, no stone clings to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-544">wood</term> or even gets stuck in it, thereby ruining all the teeth of the blade at once. Of course, one must not believe that by increasing the number of blades, the <pb n="137" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557878"/> quantity of wood cut will also be increased in the same measure. For the applied force, and not the number of blades, yields the product in a given time, and in this respect, we do not have the advantages of the English, whose driving force is in their power, while we cannot increase our often small streams by even a single drop. All other things being equal, however, with an improved device we would gain — I say it frankly — a quarter of the time and at least an eighth of the wood, which we cut into chips with our ridiculously thick blades.</p>
                <p>There are four such saws, naturally all made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term>, which are designed to hold from 10 to 25 blades at any desired interval. Each saw makes a hundred cuts per minute, though they cannot be pushed as hard <pb n="138" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557879"/> as ours, which in any case is gentle on the blades. — Of these four saws, two have a new system, without all the carriages, so that if the saw housing is open at the back and front and free-standing, one can just as easily cut a tree 60 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> long as one 6 feet long. Instead of the carriage, there are four <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">pairs of rollers</term>, two in front of the teeth and two behind the blade, about 5 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> in diameter and the same length as the width of the saw frame. These <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> rollers are sharply serrated, the lower ones being fixed and rotating only around their axis, which is connected to the switch by a wheel. The upper rollers can be moved up and down in slotted columns, so that the thinnest as well as the thickest saw logs can be placed between them, <pb n="139" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557880"/> whereby a very heavy weight attached to a serrated bar causes the sharp triangular notches of the upper and lower rollers to cut into the wood or log, pushing it forward for each cut as the switch is activated. — I saw nothing special about the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8662">circular saw</term>, except that a large <term ref="gfa-keywords-9299">ruler</term> was mounted parallel to the bench, the legs of which, as well as the band, could be regulated and, at the same time, fixed by screws as desired when cutting tapered wood.</p>
                <p>I would also like to mention two <term ref="gfa-keywords-9643">lathes</term> for making umbrella poles, which are produced here in enormous quantities. They come from the circular saw cut completely square. The pole is inserted into the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8887">conical</term> opening of the spindle head, which like the spindle itself is completely hollow, and in which, set at an angle like a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9179">plane iron</term>, <pb n="140" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557881"/> there is a cutting edge that protrudes at a proper distance, and as the iron takes away the protruding wood, it is pushed in and through, where it then emerges at the other end completely cylindrical and beautifully smooth. It is finished faster than a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8976">wood turner</term> would be able to clamp it in place and make it round. A second, similar lathe and another person make the peg in an instant, where afterwards the curved handle of the umbrella is attached. — <term ref="gfa-keywords-8879">Sanding</term> of the wood on the lathes is done with “Scouring papes” (glass or sandpaper), instead of with horse tail as <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">we</placeName> do, and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9742">polishing</term> is done very beautifully with wax and a hard wood. — To my amazement, I came here to a workshop where they were building an engine for a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8801">steamboat</term>, on which Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7775">Bellhouse</persName> himself, <pb n="141" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557882"/> as it seems, intends to fetch his wood in <placeName ref="gfa-places-105">Holland</placeName> or <placeName ref="gfa-places-109">Norway</placeName>. I did not expect to find a workshop of <persName ref="gfa-actors-7964">Vulcan</persName> here among the thousands of wooden boards and piles of sawdust. Then again, nothing is too much for the English, and nothing too heterogeneous that they do not bring together when it suits the spirit of their enterprise. Also, the location of his facility is such that he can navigate his steamboat from his door to any part of the world, since it is on the canal that connects with <placeName ref="gfa-places-1744">Hull</placeName> and <placeName ref="gfa-places-1745">Liverpool</placeName>.</p>

            <div type="day">
                <head>Auf dem Landgut der Familie Philips, 22. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, I accompanied Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7928" type="met">Phillips</persName> and his <persName ref="gfa-actors-8132" type="met">wife</persName> and <persName ref="gfa-actors-8268" type="met">daughter</persName> for lunch at his country estate, called <placeName ref="gfa-places-1944" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-22" n="71" cert="0">the Dales</placeName>, six <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> from <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName>. It is located northwest of Manchester in an exquisitely beautiful area with more hills and valleys than usual, <pb n="142" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557883"/> hence its name. — Near his estate, on its beautiful meadows and under the shade of elms and oaks, which stand together either in groups or forming small groves, his sheep, horses and cows graze in perfect contentment. Almost everywhere in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, in the parks and estates, the cattle remain outside day and night until winter. Only around <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName> is <term ref="gfa-keywords-9531">stable feeding</term> gradually gaining the upper hand. — This makes such an estate picturesque, and, as its occurrence is common, the whole country gains a cheerful appearance. Yet, it cannot be advantageous.</p>
                <p>As we had to wait for a relative who had also been invited to lunch, and meanwhile <persName ref="gfa-actors-8268">Ms. Phillips</persName>, who is a very beautiful woman, had gone to her dressing room, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7928">Phillips</persName> took me to his <term ref="gfa-keywords-9580">greenhouse</term>. I was amazed at the ef<pb n="143" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557884" break="no"/>fect of the steam on the vegetation of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9577">grapes</term>, and never in my life have I seen anything remotely similar in terms of quantity and size. This entire, rather large, greenhouse, whose sloping roof also consists of nothing but windowpanes, which is also densely covered with hanging grapes, constitutes nothing less than a vineyard. He lets the steam act not only as a form of heat in closed tubes, to create the desired temperature, but also from time to time as steam itself, which then, when it cools down, precipitates as a beneficial dew. As a result, the two great preconditions of all fertility, humidity and heat, come into being at once. — As we spoke of viticulture in our country, Mr. Phillips, who knows <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName> and spent eighteen months on the shores of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1959">Lake Geneva</placeName>, said, "You have a <pb n="144" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557885"/> <term ref="gfa-keywords-9216">climate</term>, but we must make one". Yes, I thought, if only we could do the same, for soon, if the situation continues as it is, our poor winegrowers will be condemned to drinking water forever. Incidentally, I do not give up the hope, as groundless as it may seem, that we too will be able to employ art to benefit nature.</p>
                <p>Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8086" type="met">Marc Phillips</persName>, who dined with us, is the co-owner of a large <term ref="gfa-keywords-9005">iron works</term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1945">Wales</placeName>, where they only make <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term>. He assured us that within six years we would see how Wales would prosper. Recently, incredibly rich <term ref="gfa-keywords-6116">coal and iron mines</term> have been discovered there. The same is true of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9664">blende</term>, which they now intend to use to make <term ref="gfa-keywords-9306">brass</term>, along with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term> from nearby <placeName ref="gfa-places-1881">Anglesey</placeName>. A metal<pb n="145" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557886" break="no"/>lurgical expert from <placeName ref="gfa-places-748">Saxony</placeName> is in charge of these works.</p>
                <p>During this conversation at the table, too, the complaint about the unruly <term ref="gfa-keywords-2937">workers</term>. resounded. Oh, how happy many of ours would be if they could be employed. — Of course, everything is very expensive here, but since our people are used to living far more simply, in quantity and quality, than an English worker, an ordinary one of whom can work his way up to 24, and a very excellent one to 60 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shillings</term>, or over three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8411">louis d'or</term> a week, they would certainly not fare badly.</p>

                <p>The <date when="1825-06-23">23rd</date>. Since Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7928">Phillips</persName> wished to be in <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">town</placeName> by 9 o'clock, which was also convenient for me, we ate breakfast more promptly than is usual in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> and, as always, far more abundantly than in our country. For, in addition to <term ref="gfa-keywords-9558">tea</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9197">coffee</term>, <pb n="146" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557887"/> there must always be two kinds of meat along with eggs, butter and bread. — I took leave of <persName ref="gfa-actors-8132">Mrs. Phillips</persName>, who bid me farewell with a friendly handshake, as is the custom in England in a gesture of goodwill, and likewise with their spirited <persName ref="gfa-actors-8268">daughter</persName>. Not far from Mr. <placeName ref="gfa-places-1944" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-23" n="72" cert="0">Phillips' estate</placeName>, we drove past a brand-new country church, isolated on a small hill, decorated in <term ref="gfa-keywords-9139">gothic</term> taste with two doors and built of hewn stones, which cost 14,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>, or about 150,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">fl.</term> of our money. — This church adds significant value to Mr. Phillips' estate, forming a very beautiful point de vue in the panorama of his prospect.</p>
                <p>Mr. Phillips took me to a beautiful store near the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1783">stock exchange</placeName>, after we had returned to town, <pb n="147" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557888"/> where there is an air-heating and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9398">smoke-burning stove</term> of the now most popular kind. It is very elegantly made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> and in the centre of the store, like a beautiful pedestal tapering upwards and decorated with gilded and perforated rosettes. Around the bottom, the stove is also perforated with holes. — Inside this stove there is now a second one, standing at a distance of about two <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> away from the first one on all sides, in which the heating is done. The flue runs down the inside of the stove itself, under the floor, and emerges on the outside in the courtyard with the mouth a few <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> higher than the fire in the room. The cold air now flows in at the bottom of the perforations of the outer stove, heats up considerably through contact with the inner, almost glowing hot stove, and flows out loaded with heat through the upper openings into the room, while all <pb n="148" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557889"/> smoke and steam, drawn in by the fire of the draft tube, burns off.</p>
                <p>On account of a crowd, I came to a standstill in the street leading to <placeName ref="gfa-places-2081" cert="0">my lodgings</placeName>. One after the other, the following phenomena passed me in quick succession: a funeral procession; a hired carriage; a band of soldiers with drums and flutes, newly recruited, rather brightly decorated recruits with three-coloured (green, white and orange) ribbons on the hats under their arms; the stagecoach to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1950">Stone</placeName>
                    filled with sixteen passengers; a cart with dogs; and then load-bearers with large bales, which they carry with their heads in a strap. I thought to myself as I finally made my way forward again:</p>
                <p>"That can happen in a big city,<lb/>But never with us in our provincial life."</p>
                <p>where we would have enough space to avoid each other, but neverthe<pb n="149" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557890" break="no"/>less often bump into each other in a less than friendly manner.</p>

                <p><date when="1825-06-23"><placeName ref="gfa-places-471">This afternoon</placeName></date> I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7607">Lee</persName>, who came to visit me at <placeName ref="gfa-places-2081" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-23" n="74" cert="0">my place of residence</placeName>. I realized immediately that his feelings of friendship for me had not diminished.</p>
                <p>I related to him the reason for my journey to <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> and he offered me brief advice worth more to me than that of any other person. He said, I will not tell what you should do. I will tell you what you need not do. From that, I recognized his worldly experience and profound understanding. — Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, he continued, I will pick you up for lunch at my house, then we will discuss the rest. Today, I still have the opportunity to get something for you that could be of use. — I cannot express what a feeling of well-being pervaded me upon seeing this <pb n="150" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557891"/> man again, whom one must know to appreciate properly.</p>
                <p>I wrote at home until evening and visited Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7785" type="met">Bodmer</persName>. His young compatriots were gathered at <placeName ref="gfa-places-1870" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-23" n="75" cert="0">his house</placeName> as usual. They were making the most of their time in this curious country in various fields of science and <term ref="gfa-keywords-3246">industry</term> May they all return to <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">their fatherland</placeName> healthy and well, and the benefits of their efforts be felt.</p>

                <p><date when="1825-06-24">June 24th</date>. I had almost until evening to write, for at four o'clock Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7607" type="met">Lee</persName> collected me for lunch at his <placeName ref="gfa-places-1951" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-24" n="76" cert="0">country estate</placeName>, three miles from <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName>, and once there introduced me to his three lovely and excellently brought up daughters. I say excellently, because before lunch he took me for a walk through his estate, where he was building, and laid out his plan, <pb n="151" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557892"/> according to which he had directed the education of these young women. In <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, the fair sex is more independent and moves more freely and actively in society, that is, in its world, than here, without believing that it is overstepping the bounds of the delicate sense to which it corresponds. However, it would take a great deal for two, three or four ladies on the continent to choose to travel the world in all directions without any sort of male escort (of respectability), as is not infrequently done here. — Precisely because of this independence, however, and the more distinctive rank they occupy, it is often more difficult (and especially for the richer women) to marry than it is in our country, for here some circumstances are weighed which we do not so seriously consider. Perhaps having just this in mind, one English poet very truthfully wrote:</p>
                <p><pb n="152" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557893"/> <emph rend="italic">“Such is the fate of woman Kind<lb/>They must the truth conceal,<lb/>And rather die tenthousand death<lb/>Ere they their love unveal.”</emph></p>
                <p>The great task of their education is thus that they learn to establish their happiness through and in themselves, in order to be the more independent from the outside world in the attainment of this highest good.</p>
                <p>Lunch was more Swiss than English, which I considered a compliment. There was even a napkin, which to my great regret is otherwise absent at English tables everywhere.  —  Incidentally, I am always taken aback by the cutlery “Train” that appear on the tables of both the private households and the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9234">inns</term>. It looks like a physical apparatus (for some it is a very large capital asset) to make a “comfortable din<pb n="153" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557894" break="no"/>ner”. For a stranger, especially for a complete stranger, the meaning and application of it is often puzzling and awkward.</p>
                <p>After the meal was over, I heard many more curious things from this experienced man. I asked him, among other things, why even in England some <term ref="gfa-keywords-9466">spinning mills</term> prosper while others fail. Regarding the spinning mills, he told me that it is possible, and one cannot always give the exact reasons (one of the most important and unmistakable, however, is always the larger or smaller scale according to which they were built), that the annual difference in pure <term ref="gfa-keywords-4641">profit</term> between the two can amount to 20 percent and even more. If everything goes well, the one gains 30 cents and the other 10, which is certainly respectable, but if bad <pb n="154" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557895"/> times come, as they often have, those who have had a profit of 30 cents now only gain 10, which is still a decent profit. The others, however, who already made 20 cents less, now instead of making any profit lose 10 cents, which can then soon lead to their demise.</p>
                <p>Before the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9558">tea</term>, he was kind enough to show me his <term ref="gfa-keywords-9061"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">oil-gas apparatus</term></term>, which was very neat and simple and set up exclusively for his own home. He produces 200 cubic <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> of gas each time to fill the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8550">gasometer</term>, which then provides the equivalent of 20 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term> of candles, a quantity that can last for several days even in winter. — He also testified that in his experience, where coals are not very cheap and oil not very expensive, especially in small factories <pb n="155" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557896"/> and private dwellings, oil-gas should definitely be used. Finally, I would add: the use of gas is as tasteful as the oil-gas apparatus is well designed. In the dining room, it flows copiously from a crystal lustre lamp hanging above the table, in the front of the room on the columns from chandeliers, and in the back of the room from the leafy stems of sunflowers, held in the hands of two dainty female figures about three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> high and perched in niches, forming veritable sunflowers of fire. — With pleasure and gratitude, and the hope of seeing them again in <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName>, I left the hospitable home of this so respectable family.</p>

                <p>The <placeName ref="gfa-places-471"><date when="1825-06-25">25th</date></placeName>. This morning I received from Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7607">Lee</persName> a letter of introduction to Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8088">Y.</persName>, Associé in the large <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8089">iron works and foundry at H. O.</orgName> near <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Bir<pb n="156" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557897" break="no"/>mingham</placeName>, then wrote a long letter in reply to Mr. Lee, reserved a seat in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8570">diligence</term> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName> tomorrow, and finished the evening by packing my things.</p>
                <p>Sunday, <date when="1825-06-26">June 26th</date>. At breakfast I read the famous English newspaper <term ref="gfa-keywords-9665">"The Times"</term> and in it an article from <term ref="gfa-keywords-9666"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7837">Galignani's messenger</persName></term>, <date when="1825-06-24">June 24, 1825</date>, from which we in <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName> learn what to do with the snow on our mountains. An English traveller, coming from <placeName ref="gfa-places-72">Italy</placeName>, was annoyed by it and, in his annoyance, wrote in the newspaper: "The Swiss cantons are very reproachable that they completely neglect to sweep away the snow, but leave it until the sun or the rain melts it.”</p>
                <p>Via <placeName ref="gfa-places-1953" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-26" n="78">Oldhum</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1954" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-26" n="79">Marsden</placeName> and <placeName ref="gfa-places-1955" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-26" n="80">Huddersfield</placeName>, I made my way to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-26" n="81">Leeds</placeName>, where, as the northernmost destination of my journey, I arrived, according to the date, just one <pb n="157" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557898"/> month after leaving <placeName ref="gfa-places-131">home</placeName>. We left <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName> at half past eleven in the morning to cover the forty-four <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> in six hours. The country, especially between Marsden and Huddersfield, is predominantly heath and peat, and although it is hilly, almost mountainous, it is a rather sad prospect. From Huddersfield to Leeds, however, it changes. It is a beautiful valley that seems to stretch from southeast to northwest, with mountains of some significance running along it. The landscape had a Swiss-like quality similar to that of our flat regions. Richly coloured fields, tree groves and meadows alternated. Along the mountains, and even on top of them, there were individual houses, white, not, as in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, red ones that look a single large brick. Now and then, forests <pb n="158" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557899"/>
                    covered the slopes. Yet for all that, I missed the clear streams, the running springs, the linden tree in the village and the joyful singing of the youth, the vine-covered houses and the fruit trees along the streets of <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">our fatherland</placeName>. — The rays of the sun fall more obliquely on this land, it can colour the leaves of the trees, but it does not ripen fruit.</p>
                <p>I was very much looking forward to seeing the highly respectable <persName ref="gfa-actors-8090">Gott</persName> family again here, for whom I have such great esteem. That same evening, I was handed a package of letters by their <persName ref="gfa-actors-7842">youngest son</persName>, which had made their way from <persName ref="gfa-actors-1237"><persName ref="gfa-actors-6139">home</persName></persName> to here. — I spent the remainder of the day responding to them.</p>

            <div type="day">
                <head>Stadtführung durch Leeds, 27. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <date when="1825-06-27">27th</date>. Early in the morning, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7842" type="met">Henry Gott</persName> collected me from my residence to spend <pb n="159" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557900"/> the day with his <persName ref="gfa-actors-8090">family</persName>. — Leaving the office, where I spoke with Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697" type="met">Gott</persName> about my affairs and the purpose of my journey and received from him friendly advice and equally friendly offers of introductions into the circles of <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England's</placeName> most distinguished men, <persName ref="gfa-actors-7842">his son</persName> and I proceeded to the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8329"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2055" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-27" n="82" cert="0">Northern Exhibition</placeName></orgName>, where a very fine collection of paintings by English artists from the last two years was on display.</p>
                <p>Among them, I immediately noticed and most appreciated, a life-size portrait, I believe, of <persName ref="gfa-actors-7862">Lord Howden</persName> by the President of the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8288">Royal Academy</orgName>, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7883">Lawrence</persName>. — It is said, and I believe it, that he was the best of the portrait <term ref="gfa-keywords-9371">painters</term> still living. This piece cost over six hundred <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>. Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7607">Lee</persName>, at whose house I first saw only a bust above the mantelpiece <pb n="160" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557901"/> which cost 250 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8536">guineas</term>, told me that he could earn the above-mentioned price for his work, and if he were so inclined, he could earn 20,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term> per year. This is how excellent art and special skill are rewarded in England!</p>
                <p>We left the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8329"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2055" cert="0">northern Exhibition</placeName></orgName> for the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1973" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-27" n="83" cert="0">Philosophical-Hall</placeName>, a very beautiful building that was only recently erected and that owes its existence to the spirit of cooperation and community of the English, who through subscriptions easily accomplish things of which we have yet to conceive. — The purpose of the building is to teach <term ref="gfa-keywords-3048">physics</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-604">chemistry</term>. The necessary instruments, a <term ref="gfa-keywords-2324">laboratory</term> and a beautiful lecture hall are all available there for this purpose. There is also a fine collection of English minerals and fossils and well-preserved but not <pb n="161" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557902"/> very numerous specimens from the animal kingdom. Some excellently preserved <term ref="gfa-keywords-9325">mummies</term>, which have not been here long, interested me, as Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName> mentioned that the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9178">hieroglyphs</term> on the coffins of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9860">Sycamore wood</term>, so excellently preserved and in the most vivid colours, had been interpreted with ease and unanimity by two young people here, who had received the key to them from someone in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1974">Oxford</placeName>.  — It is a petition of the deceased to the spirits of the air to allow them, despite having done some bad things during their lifetimes, as well as many good things, to pass through their domain into the regions of supreme bliss, to which they now aspire. — Detailed "cross examinations", a method introduced in England especially at the courts of justice to investigate the truth, and as it has probably nowhere so thoroughly established, confirmed the <pb n="162" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557903"/> correctness of the interpretation. Thus, the spirit of research in our age penetrates even into this mystical darkness of an earlier cult, which has been without light for thousands of years.</p>
                <p>We had hoped to visit the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1976" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-27" n="84" cert="0">oil-gas works</placeName>, that now illuminates a part of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName>, so that the city now enjoys its bright and odourless flame, but the caretaker had gone to lunch. In the courtyard, I noticed that the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8882">retorts</term> in which the oil is decomposed are vertical, not horizontal; however, there are two of them, one inside the other, so that they can be easily emptied of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">cokes</term> that is inserted so that the oil can drip onto them until they are saturated, at which point they are replaced with new ones. The outer retort is made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term>, the inner one of strong <term ref="gfa-keywords-8993">sheet iron</term>, which is then pulled out on a hook together <pb n="163" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557904"/> with the cokes. The entire thing, like all <term ref="gfa-keywords-9061"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">oil-gas apparatus</term></term>, occupies a very small space. The key factor is to ensure that the oil-gas is conducted one last time through cool oil before it is fed into the pipes, which condenses and retains as oil the oil vapours that sometimes accompany oil-gas so as to prevent them from causing smoke and odour during combustion. — The <term ref="gfa-keywords-8550">gasometer</term> for this apparatus is located in the courtyard. It is round, constructed of cast iron plates, and contains 18,000 cubic <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> of gas. The inner movable part is made of sheet iron, riveted, and coated with tar on the inside and outside.</p>

                <head>Besuch der Textilfabrik Park Mill, 27. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>From <placeName ref="gfa-places-1976" cert="0">there</placeName>, <persName ref="gfa-actors-7842"><persName ref="gfa-actors-35">we</persName></persName> we visited the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9585">cloth factory</term> for which Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName> is responsible, called <placeName ref="gfa-places-1795" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-27" n="85">Park mill</placeName>. — I had visited it <date to="1814-09-05" from="1814-09-03">eleven years ago</date>, yet I was amazed not only at the extremely significant enlargements <pb n="164" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557905"/> he had made, but also at the incredibly short time and the way in which they were carried out.</p>
                <p>In addition to a brand-new <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term> of eighty <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">horsepower</term>, whose flywheel alone, measuring 30 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> in diameter and, naturally, made entirely of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term>, weighs over 22½ tons, or 45,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term>, there are two new, completely fireproof buildings, each six stories high. Were it not for the many extraordinary things that have happened due to the immense strength and vitality of this nation together with its calm, confident calculus and exact knowledge of its strengths, and of the extent to which each of them must contribute his own to their common purpose, I would hardly dare, without being suspected of exaggeration, to record here that only the smaller of these buildings has more than a hundred cross-bar windows on each of its two long fronts. What is more, <pb n="165" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557906"/> the larger one was erected in three months and the smaller one in six weeks from the ground up to the roof, including the floors inside (about whose construction I will speak in a moment) and that the master builder was to be fined 50 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term> if he did not finish it within this time. — Of course, they did not lay the bricks, as it was done under Queen <persName ref="gfa-actors-7820">Dido</persName>,*)<note n="*" type="original" place="bottom">*) They layer brick as slow as snails.</note> we are told by <persName ref="gfa-actors-7784">Blumauer</persName> in his <term ref="gfa-keywords-9667">travestied Aeneid</term>, though we are often led to believe we are living in those times in this respect.</p>
                <p>The construction of these buildings, which are all of brick, is exceedingly simple. — The pillars between the windows are very solid, as they bear the entire load and support the building. <pb n="166" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557907"/> Depending on the width of the building (30 to 32, or 45 to 48 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term>), hollow cast iron columns are placed on very solid masonry foundations, or on very large and regularly hewn ashlar stones, always opposite the centre of the pillar and of the desired height of the floors. — In the pillars themselves, on the one hand, and on the capitals of the columns, on the other hand, there are iron beams of the required length, which, at 12 to 14 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> high, are not fully 2 inches thick, but at the bottom have a flat projection of 3 inches on each side, on which the flat vault, which resembles the former ceilings of our stories, is placed. Where the beams rest on either side, they still have a wide plate or foot specially cast on, on account of the sway, to combat which there is also a joint of forged <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron rods</term>, <pb n="167" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557908"/> horizontal to the length of the building. In the same way, these cast beams, each of which usually weighs 15 to 20 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">centner</term>, form a straight line from below, but from the top a pressed curve, which also contributes to their load-bearing strength. Since there has been great misfortune in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName>, and especially in <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName>, due to the breaking of these beams and the subsequent collapse of parts of buildings, the beams are carefully tested by placing each one on a straight line at both ends and pressing on its centre with a lever force of 300 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8451">Ztr.</term> or 15 tons. — I was present at such a test in Leeds. The beam flexed or sank half an inch but did not break.</p>
                <p>Since the English, with their pre<pb n="168" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557909" break="no"/>sent system of building, of machinery and navigation, must so variously entrust their lives and fortunes to iron, they are very careful in the selection, each time, of this highly heterogeneous <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metal</term> for its intended purpose.</p>
                <p>Now, when the ceilings are finished, the hollow space formed by their curvature is filled with rubble, and on this are laid the slabs of stone which constitute the floor. This is done from floor to floor until the roof is reached. The rafters of the roof are also made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> and consist of two somewhat compressed quarter circles, which are connected to each other at the top, what we call the ridge, by screws and by forged iron rods. The battens, twice as strong as ours, are of <term ref="gfa-keywords-544">wood</term>, or, but then much thinner, of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8509">bar iron</term>. The roofing is of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9426">slate</term> or thin <pb n="169" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557910"/> sandstone slabs, rarely of tiles and very rarely of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8993">iron</term> or <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper sheet</term></term>. This latter, certainly the most beautiful and solid work, they do not know as well as we do in <placeName ref="gfa-places-35">Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Inside, the roofs all have a coating of mortar, which is very good and makes what we otherwise call the stage (screed) like a room. They know nothing of skylights (dormers, louvre), though for illumination there is usually a row of windows in the roofs in <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast-iron</term> frames. The cementing of all joints is done with a mixture of unslaked <term ref="gfa-keywords-9198">lime</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9270">linseed oil</term>, which they consider best. So, this incombustible building was constructed, in which I almost felt like a mountaineer who forgot to build a staircase for his <term ref="gfa-keywords-9342">observatory</term>. The stairs are, however, generally not very wide and made of stone or iron. By steam <pb n="170" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557911"/> or by heated air, these massive dwellings of trade are warmed from below, and when the light of day has disappeared, they are illuminated by the silent flame of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8864">hydrogen gas</term>. Since the equipment for these two processes is located at least in a separate building, there is no danger even for the (often very flammable) materials that are processed in these factories.</p>
                <p>It is quite well known on the continent how <term ref="gfa-keywords-8822">wool</term>, of whatever kind, passes through all the stages of sorting, washing, dyeing and machine spinning and weaving, along with other necessary operations, while the relatively new method of shearing fabric is hardly known at all. Whereas according to the old method, on the somewhat <term ref="gfa-keywords-9668">cambered</term> or round elevated tables, advancement of the cloth is hardly visible, <pb n="171" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557912"/> I do not think I am exaggerating when I assume the average speed of the cloth's advancement in its entire width to be five seconds per <term ref="gfa-keywords-8599">ell</term>, as such is impeccably and beautifully demonstrated on this new machine. One must admire the simplicity of the idea. Equally so, however, the artistry of the iron and steel worker in regard to the extreme accuracy that the execution this idea requires.</p>

                <p>With <persName ref="gfa-actors-7701" type="met">Madame Gott</persName>, who had come to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">city</placeName> in the morning, her son's wife and another lady, I travelled to her <placeName ref="gfa-places-1794" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-27" n="86">country estate</placeName>, three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> from <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName>, to stay there until the following day. This country estate is a castle, entirely of hewn stone and beautifully executed, with a frontispiece supported by Ionic columns. — The interior is equally as impressive as the exterior. The parlour and the tea<pb n="172" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557913" break="no"/>room were full of precious paintings, among which (as the only <term ref="gfa-keywords-2837">engraving</term>) <term ref="gfa-keywords-9669"><persName ref="gfa-actors-8243">Müller's incomparable Madonna</persName></term> was exceptional. Among the paintings that struck and particularly interested me was one of the celebrated British poet <persName ref="gfa-actors-7949">Walter Scott</persName>, together with his friends and a few ladies, all portraits, all dressed in traditional rural or other fantastic costumes and attending a “Village wake”. There was even a piper with him dressed in Scottish “Highlands Garb”. Naturally, there was a pianoforte in this magnificent room, as well as the harp of <persName ref="gfa-actors-8280">Erin</persName>, the Turkish sofas and fainting couches, and the “Screen” — how pleased I was with the tender show of respect expressed by it — depicting our <placeName ref="gfa-places-125">Rhine Falls</placeName> in the moonlight. I regretted, however, that the two most amiable <pb n="173" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557914"/> daughters, who had been with their brother in <placeName ref="gfa-places-131">Schafhausen</placeName> in the latter part of <date to="1824-12-31" from="1824-09-01">last year</date>, were away on a visit.</p>
                <p>Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7857" type="met">Hewes</persName>, a very accomplished architect and millwright from <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName>, was present at lunch. Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName> commissioned him to build a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9081">chain bridge</term> a hundred <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> wide not far from his second factory, called <placeName ref="gfa-places-1788">Armsley Watermill</placeName>. The bridge differs from all others in that the sides, as well as the floor, are erected on the chains instead of hanging down from them, as is usually the case.</p>
                <p>Not until midnight — we lingered after <term ref="gfa-keywords-9558">tea</term> for some time in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-1883">library</term>, which contained almost nothing but magnificent or otherwise selected works — did Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName> show me to my bedroom. Here under this window, Mr. Gott remarked, five years ago at this time, stood your now deceased friend, <pb n="174" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557915"/> Professor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7930">Pictet</persName> of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1196">Geneva</placeName>. With the clock in his hand just as it turned midnight, he observed the effect of the twilight, which does not completely disappear on the longest days at our latitude and was pleased to be able to discern the position of the hands and the minute on the dial with its faint glimmer. — Bless him, who has departed this life and now passed from our twilight into the radiant glow of a higher life, I said to my friend, offering him my hand in good night.</p>

                <head>Besuch der Textilfabrik Armsley Watermill, 28. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <placeName ref="gfa-places-1794"><date when="1825-06-28">28th</date></placeName>. After breakfast, before which I took a walk with Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName> through his <placeName ref="gfa-places-1794" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-28" n="87">park</placeName> and viewed with pleasure the beautiful surrounding landscape with such distinctive features as the picturesque <term ref="gfa-keywords-9409">ruins</term> of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9139">gothic</term> <placeName ref="gfa-places-1975">monastery Kirkdale</placeName>, destroyed in the <date to="1547-01-28" from="1509-04-24"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7854">time of Henry the Eighth</persName></date>, and <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName> with its multitudinous smoking chimneys, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9341">obelisk-like</term> <pb n="175" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557916"/> in the distance, as well as the deep-lying canal and River <placeName ref="gfa-places-1872" cert="0">Car</placeName>, visible at several bends. After having bid farewell to this <persName ref="gfa-actors-8090">family</persName>, which I hold in such high esteem, we proceeded via Mr. Gott's second factory, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1788" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-28" n="88">Armsley Watermill</placeName><note>Das Stadtviertel, welchem die Fabrik ihren Namen zu verdanken hat, heisst Armley, und nicht Armsley.</note>, to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">city</placeName>. This factory, which is very rare in England, is driven by <term ref="gfa-keywords-2998">waterpower</term>, with a hydraulic force almost equivalent to a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term> of 120 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">horsepower</term>. It pushes 160 cubic feet of water every second at a drop of 10 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term>. Three, with the exception of the shovels, completely iron wheels, each 20 feet high, one 24, the other 18 feet wide (the third is unknown to me), drive the various works and are arranged in such a way that either one alone, or two, or all three can set the main engine in motion, so that even if there is a problem with the hydraulic structure or with one or the other water wheel, <pb n="176" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557917"/> the factory can continue to operate. As this factory is quite similar to the one in the city, I have nothing further to remark.  — I must say, however, that it required the genius, the tremendous drive and perseverance of a man like Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName>, to found such an establishment, in which more than 1200 workers are employed (and he also has the great merit of having built the first factory of this kind in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName>, where several more have been built since then), and to manage it with the greatest success, even in the most difficult times, e.g. during the war, when he employed twice the number of people for several years, having to work day and night. Both his <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">country</placeName> and the government, in any case, recognize his merits, as he enjoys their greatest respect and confidence.</p>
                <p><pb n="177" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557918"/> When I asked him along the way about the status of mechanical <term ref="gfa-keywords-9466">flax mills</term>, he pointed to a building half a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">mile</term> away and said: "[T]his <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8093">Establishment</orgName> is likely to prosper most in our country. [I]t is the best Flaxmill [I] know of". As little as it interests me personally, I would have liked very much, indeed, more than anything else, to see this manufactory, which, as far as I know, in spite of the alluring price of a million <term ref="gfa-keywords-8571">francs</term> in <date to="1814-04-06" from="1804-12-02"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7486">Napoleon's time</persName></date>, after the effort of the best minds and the prospect of considerable <term ref="gfa-keywords-4641">profit</term> in the event of success, has not been implemented in its perfection anywhere on the continent. — Sensing my unspoken wish, he added: "Although it is extremely difficult to enter, perhaps impossible by existing rules, I will introduce you to the owner, <pb n="178" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557919"/> and you will have to take your chances, though I ought not do this too often". — Back in the office, he gave me a very carefully worded letter. Something I admire greatly about the English is that they respect each other's intellectual as well as their material property, and that they do not, as I have encountered in <placeName ref="gfa-places-84">my own steel works</placeName>, climb in at the windows when they cannot get in at the door. His letter was such that the mill owner could still have refused me without compromising himself or Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697">Gott</persName>, nor being impolite to me.</p>

            <div type="day">
                <head>Besuch der Flachsspinnerei Marshall Mills, 28. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>I was disappointed to find that Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8092" type="met">M.</persName> was not present when I arrived at the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9466"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8093"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1977" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-28" n="89" cert="0">spinning mill</placeName></orgName></term>; however, I was assured he would return. In the meantime, I had a curious conversation with a man who appeared to be first commissioner.  — After subjecting me to a private interview, <pb n="179" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557920" break="no"/> he began to question me, without further context, whether the people in <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">my country</placeName> were also happy? — I said that it all depended on what one understood by it. For I did not know what happiness or unhappiness was, as the concepts varied. However, if it were a matter of how people perceived it in the most general and almost universally adopted sense, namely eating and drinking well, enjoying themselves, leading a carefree life, etc., then not everyone had succeeded, however much they might be inclined to do so in our country, but in the meantime we could not complain particularly.</p>
                <p>To this he replied that everyone could succeed if only they wanted to and had I read the writings of Owen?<note>Es ist unklar, ob hier «A New View of Society» (1813/1816) oder «An Explanation of the Cause of Distress which pervades the civilised parts of the world» (1823) gemeint ist.</note> — I said I know Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7924">Owen</persName> personally and appreciate his philanthropy, though I have not read any of his writings. — Take <pb n="180" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557921"/> this, he said, opening a desk and handing me a printed and folded pamphlet. Put it in your pocket and take it with you to your country. This sheet contains all that is necessary to make people happy. I did quickly as he said, for Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8092">M.</persName> had entered the office and, without taking notice of our philosophical exchange, requested that I step into the adjoining room with him, where I was to pass an even more severe examination. I certainly believe that without knowing the English language and without a certain tact, to win over these sincere but cautious people, so full of character (I cannot find a word in our rich language at present to convey my meaning), which, however, is neither done with bows, nor with one's hat under the arm, for here in this country they prefer to leave them <pb n="181" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557922"/> where they belong, without a letter of introduction from so substantial a person, I might well have been sent away again unsatisfied, for at first Mr. M. did not appear disposed to playing the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8921">Cicerone</term> in his own factory. — Then, all of a sudden, he stood up and told me to go with him.</p>
                <p>He took me first to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term>, which stands in a small and extremely clean room, and which on account of its beautiful outward perfection resembles a great physical instrument, which it actually is. It was built in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName>, probably by the renowned <persName ref="gfa-actors-7700">Murray</persName>. — I was almost frightened by the high-speed rotation of the flywheel driven by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">seventy-horsepower</term> engine, for only a few days ago one such wheel flew off as a result of overwhelming <term ref="gfa-keywords-9631">centrifugal force</term> and almost destroyed an entire building, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. — There is no attendant at this machine, <pb n="182" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557923"/> incidentally, for it pumps its own water and pours its own coals through a large mill hopper onto the continuously rotating grate.</p>
                <p>From the steam engine, he led me to the warehouse for raw <term ref="gfa-keywords-9049">flax</term>, consisting partly of <placeName ref="gfa-places-127">Russian</placeName> and partly of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1623">Flemish</placeName> flax, which he preferred. As the fireproof room where the spun flax is dried was adjacent, he led me inside. The temperature may have been 28° <term ref="gfa-keywords-8567">Reaumur</term>, and it is maintained neither by proper air nor <term ref="gfa-keywords-8941">steam heating</term>, but directly through contact of the room air with four very wide (2 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term>) <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> pipes running the entire length of the room; in other words, proper ovens. Directly adjacent to this was the room with the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9671">beating hammers</term>, where the yarn is uncoiled from the bobbins and the strands are wound, <pb n="183" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557924"/> the size of which is determined by the contour, and a certain number of which then form a bundle of 15 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term>. I was reluctant to inquire about the actual sequence and the maximum grist, so I inquired instead how long a thread would be if one were to unwind an entire bundle, which seemed quite fine to me. I was told that it would be 160,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8604">yards</term>, or 250,000 of our cubits, or about 28 hours. We then arrived at the operating rooms themselves, where, instead of being on level ground as before, we now ascended beneath the roof. There, the hackling was done using the same procedures as our own. Due to the horrible dust, the windows remain open summer and winter. — In a second room, the flax was fed through even finer <term ref="gfa-keywords-9792">hackles</term> and and arranged in perfect bundles before being trans<pb n="184" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557925" break="no"/>ferred to the machine hackles. These simultaneously perform the wonderful operations of eliminating the short fibres for use in other purposes, so that only fibres of the same length remain; and of carefully and very quickly separating these fibres, which are now generally of the same length, into very long strands, a process in which the hand and eye of the women who perform this task are very skilled. The secret of all <term ref="gfa-keywords-9466">machine spinning</term>, the drawing of the slivers for the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9264">lamination mills</term> and the pre-spinning to reduce defects, was so well considered here, as was the removal of all dust and boon from the slivers by brushing, instead of the cleaning cylinders, as in cotton spinning, that excellent results were inevitable. More than merely the beauty, uniformity, softness and strength of the thread, these results are possible with a single <term ref="gfa-keywords-9213">child</term> monitoring both machines, <pb n="185" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557926"/> which are always positioned facing each other and each of which encompasses fifty <term ref="gfa-keywords-9465">spindles</term>. More often than not, there was nothing for them to do, so seldom did the threads break. These (throstle-frame) machines had three pairs of cylinders, one above the other, of decreasing dimension. In the last or lowest one, before passing through them, just before turning, the thread was wetted in an ingenious way. When one sees the astonishing waste that occurs up to the point where the flax reaches its final stage, where it is sufficiently suited for fine spinning, one would think there is no great advantage to be gained from all this. Indeed, the waste is only illusory, as it is used in all its gradations for other purposes. I saw hundreds of bundles of packing cloth in the warehouse, for example, which is made of waste material from the penultimate phase of production. — Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8092">M.</persName> drew my attention to an experiment that <pb n="186" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557927"/> was, in fact, an old one, but which, as it seems, is being taken up anew in order to reduce the amount of waste; namely, to cut the flax. They are not yet completely satisfied with the results; however, from what I observed on the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8916">carding machine</term>, they are determined to persevere. I counted the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9467">fine spinning machines</term> in one room. There were two rows of 25 each, and since, as far as I remember, we had visited four such rooms, this means that 20,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-9465">spindles</term> are in operation every day, which, including the preparatory operations, is still far from exhausting the capacity of the steam engine. New construction work is already underway. This factory, like all English factories almost without exception, constitutes a well conceived whole, down to the smallest details. Among all the facilities, I liked the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9792">hackle</term> and fibre sorting machines most, <pb n="187" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557928"/> as well as the well-designed transfer of the slivers to the roving machine. To what extent all this is the same elsewhere, I cannot say, since I have not seen any other factory of this kind. —  When I left, after Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8092">M.</persName> had spent over an hour and a half with me, I thanked him for the privilege of having seen these beautiful and correspondingly impressive facilities. He remarked only that they had not yet reached the same level of progress as in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9466">cotton spinning mill</term>, and that he hoped to introduce some improvements within a few years.</p>

                <head>Abschied in Leeds, 28. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>I returned to <persName ref="gfa-actors-7697"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1788">Mr. Gott's office</placeName></persName>. There I saw an exceptional stock of fabric of all kinds, despite the daily shipments. I especially liked the beautiful and inexpensive woollen coverlets. Only through the combination of such diverse <pb n="188" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557929"/> and extensive resources is it possible to sell such exquisite merchandise so cheaply.</p>
                <p>As the capstone of so much gratifying friendship, I received two very valuable letters of introduction and, something I had been longing for and which had been waiting for me for so long, namely, a detailed description of how "home brew'd Ale and Porter"<note>Dunkles, oft tiefschwarzes Bier mit einem malzigen oder gar röstmalzbetonten Geschmack.</note> are made, together with a beautiful and very clear scale drawing of the entire apparatus, from the kitchen down to the cellar, where this beverage, so dear to me, is kept to be enjoyed once it is fully aged.</p>
                <p><persName ref="gfa-actors-7701">Madame Gott</persName> was kind enough to advise me verbally in advance about some precautions to be taken when <term ref="gfa-keywords-8669"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8829">brewing beer</term></term> in the house and especially about the meticulous cleaning of the utensils, which must be scrubbed <pb n="189" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557930"/> with hot water after each use.</p>
                <p>I took leave of my friends, and they said until we meet again in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>. Alas, the years roll by, and one does not travel to England more often than to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8770">pyramids</term> of Egypt. After this farewell, I had no desire to take in any more outside impressions and, writing down the above, remained at home for the rest of the day.</p>

                <head>Über die Rechte der Frauen, 29. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>The <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760"><date when="1825-06-29">29th</date></placeName>. I reproached myself upon awakening for having had the <ref type="cross" target="../1825/44">recipe for human happiness</ref> in my pocket all evening without knowing its contents, after all, one never knows what might happen in a single night. — I rang for breakfast to gather strength so that I might soar among the sublime ideas which, of course, this wonderful paper must contain. The introduction was <pb n="190" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557931"/> as splendid and philosophical as that to the constitution of the former <placeName ref="gfa-places-1978" cert="0">Cisalpine Republic</placeName>. Indeed, how my spirits were dashed then to find that one may obtain happiness by joining a "Cooporativ Society", which likely even now exists only on paper and which, among other things, not very covertly expresses the principle of the Communia Bonorum<note>Lat. für «Gemeinschaft der Güter»: Gesellschaftsordnung, in der kein Privateigentum existiert, sondern alle Mitglieder einer Gemeinschaft in gleichem Masse Zugang zu Gütern haben.</note>, for only ten, twenty, or forty <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>. Of course, only those who pay forty pounds may immediately enter this heavenly kingdom, nota bene with the proviso that the houses of this community must first be built. The others must wait. Upon surveying the plan as a whole, it seemed to me something like a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9673">prebendary hospital</term>.</p>
                <p>Since, however, the great truth is also expressed in this writing that the fair sex constitutes just half of the human race, <pb n="191" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557932"/> and that it therefore also possesses the same rights as the stronger sex, it is my duty, having assumed responsibility for the promulgation<note>Bekanntmachung, Veröffentlichung, Bekanntgabe.</note> of these glories, to quote here verbatim and in extendo<note>Korrekte Schreibweise: in extenso. Lat. für «in aller Ausführlichkeit, vollständig».</note> the passages concerning women in particular.</p>
                <p>Rights of women. To the female sex, since it constitutes approximately half of the human race, and since they are equally capable of contributing to human happiness and equally entitled to the personal enjoyment thereof, we promise and pledge eligibility and appointment to any position in society to which their individual talents and inclinations may render them capable, just as to men. We also promise them the same means and rights for the acquisition of knowledge and the enjoyment of social pleasures and <pb n="192" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557933"/> complete personal freedom of opinion and action, as well as equal entitlement to property and physical means of enjoyment, as men; furthermore, we promise them complete exemption from such menial domestic occupations as cooking, washing, heating rooms, etc. All this is to be done according to scientific principles and on a large economic scale for the whole society. —  Each may form his own opinion of these absurdities.</p>

                <p>This afternoon at 2 o'clock, I left <placeName ref="gfa-places-1760">Leeds</placeName> for <placeName ref="gfa-places-1265" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-29" n="91">Sheffield</placeName> via <placeName ref="gfa-places-1791" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-29" n="90">Wakefield</placeName>. The travelling party consisted of a lady of about thirty dressed in mourning, a gentleman from Sheffield, and later we were joined by another lady. — I soon fell asleep, rather soundly it seemed, not waking until our next stop. Sir, you have slept <pb n="193" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557934"/> soundly, said the lady, to me, though very kindly.  — I apologized for my impoliteness and attributed it to the strong <term ref="gfa-keywords-8829">ale</term> I had enjoyed. — I have something for you that will help you sleep, she said, pulling out a pocketbook, and from the pocketbook a pouch, and from the pouch a piece of paper. It was a kind of green <term ref="gfa-keywords-9072">tobacco</term>, I was made to sniff it, as was my travelling companion, with whom it did not agree, though the other woman would have none of it. The remedy worked, meanwhile, and after covering 33 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term>, I arrived in Sheffield soon after 6 o'clock in the evening, where I used the remaining time to become acquainted with the places that might be of interest to me the following day. Nothing is easier to discover in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> than this. For even when the buildings and factories <pb n="194" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557935"/> are sometimes closed, or entry is forbidden, there is always written on the outside in very large letters that can be read at a great distance, what goes on and what product is made inside. — I only saw the steel drawing mill ("Tiltinghouse"), a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9509">cast and annealed steel factory</term>, a refractory <term ref="gfa-keywords-9633">brick manufactory</term>, a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9395">razor blade factory</term>, a grinding and polishing mill, a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8973">wire drawing mill</term> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8482">cast steel</term>, and a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9245">rolling mill</term>, where <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> and cast steel are stretched in very small quantities, as the most important things for me, and, having given myself a great deal of work to do, retired to bed early.</p>

                <p><placeName ref="gfa-places-1265"><date when="1825-06-30">June 30th</date></placeName>. The <placeName ref="gfa-places-1979" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="92" cert="0">Tiltinghouse</placeName> is an <term ref="gfa-keywords-9166">iron mill</term> driven by the waters of the river <placeName ref="gfa-places-1668">Don</placeName>, which flows through the city. Though quite modern, the mill is, oddly enough, built in the style of an old <term ref="gfa-keywords-9205">fort</term>, with four towers, battlements, high Gothic windows and cross slates. <pb n="195" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557936"/> The English adore the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9139">Gothic</term> style immensely and sometimes apply it even in places where it is certainly not appropriate. — As I noted already <date to="1814-09-22" from="1814-08-07">eighteen years ago</date>, they lag behind us in German-speaking lands with regard to the equipment and operation of ironworks. There are four <term ref="gfa-keywords-9099">refining hammers</term> here, two larger and two smaller ones, of which only one large and one small is in operation at any given time. These operate by virtue of the immense force of water; however, the output could have been doubled if they had been arranged differently. Hammers and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8658">anvils</term> are, as everywhere in England, T-shaped and furnished with grooves. The heating furnace is different from that in German-speaking lands. Since they do not have <term ref="gfa-keywords-8697">charcoals</term>, the <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term> would burn in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">cokes</term>. Direct contact with the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8474">coals</term> would damage it, so the steel to be drawn is <pb n="196" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557937"/> tempered in the naked flame, which is most effective. I brought a piece of my <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term> to be drawn from its current thickness into <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razor</term> form. They were reluctant at first, but in the end, I persuaded them to do so. What seemed interesting to me was the connection of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9433">grindstone</term> for adjusting the hammer harness by means of a "geer wheel", with the slanted combs cast on the ring in which the tappet or cam for driving the hammer are inserted. — From there, I proceeded to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1980" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="93" cert="0"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9519">cast steel manufactory</term></placeName> where I announced myself at the office. I wished to obtain a price list, a chipped piece of "<term ref="gfa-keywords-9510">Ingot Steel</term>" and a piece of thin, square rolled steel. The following day, I went to pick it up and offered to pay half a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8586">crown</term> for it, which they accepted only after refusing several times. They did not even <pb n="197" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557938"/> want to know who I was or what I wanted. Generally, this is quite pleasant about England. No annoying innkeeper asking you: Excuse me, where are you from? May I ask where you are going? etc. etc. One moves freely as if in one's own house, and everyone respects the other's right to privacy.</p>
                <p>After the clerk had shown me the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9629">cement kiln</term>, I went to the casting house and, since I had permission, waited to see the casting from two furnaces. There were six of them in total. I noticed that they were different from the ones I had seen before. Each furnace now contained two <term ref="gfa-keywords-8532">crucibles</term> instead of one and also held more <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metal</term> than before, namely 33 to 36 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term>. They had a different shape and were of the same composition as the old Huntsman<note>Es ist unklar, ob Fischer den Vater, <persName ref="gfa-actors-7703">William Huntsman (1733–1809)</persName>, oder den Grossvater, <persName ref="gfa-actors-7702">Benjamin Huntsman (1704–1776)</persName>, meint.</note> had used for a long time. When the furnace was opened, and the worker lifted out the cru<pb n="198" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557939" break="no"/>cible to pass it to the other one who was pouring, it leaked. A helper quickly threw a piece of wet glue on the crack, so that about half the bar was still able to be poured. The other bars were all good. They have <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">three-foot-long</term> <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> forges, They have three-foot-long cast iron forges, which are flat and octagonal and fit very exactly into one another. For <term ref="gfa-keywords-3621">rolling</term> the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheets</term>, they have very wide, low and thin ones. — Having seen how the crucibles were filled and composed, I understood how those who use the sheet metal rolled from this steel to make <term ref="gfa-keywords-9591">watch springs</term> are sometimes so far off in their calculations. Cold rain drove me home, where I was welcomed by a barely lit fireplace burning with dark, uncertain flames.</p>
                <p> I truly believe, I thought to myself, that only <term ref="gfa-keywords-8474">hard coals</term> are burned in Hell. When <persName ref="gfa-actors-7904">Milton</persName> depicts the fire <pb n="199" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557940"/> there: "Flames that give no light but rather darkness visible," he most certainly had in mind the sad flame of a chimney fire, black at the edges as if departing from life. — These pseudo-coals, extracted from the eternally dark and damp tombs of the earth, never experienced the invigorating and exalting rays of the sun, never identified with them, as did our eternally green trees, the spruces and firs, whose coals burn with such a vital glow and luminous flame.</p>

                <head>Innovation Rasiermesser aus Meteorstahl, 30. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>I was curious to know what an English <term ref="gfa-keywords-9305">cutler</term> would have to say about my <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term> if I gave him some to make a few <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razors</term>. — Chance led me to a building where I was told I could find a <placeName ref="gfa-places-1981" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="94" cert="0">manufactory</placeName>. — There was a friendly looking gentleman in the warehouse. I <pb n="200" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557941"/> asked him if he would like to make me a few razors this evening — it was a little past 3 o'clock in the afternoon. He said yes, but that he would have to know what kind. I answered: very simple ones, and that I would supply the steel and wished to be present at the <term ref="gfa-keywords-2759">forging</term> in order to explain what was necessary due to the peculiarity of the steel. After I had shown him the steel, which at one end still bore the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8452">Damask</term> pattern and which he examined attentively without saying a word, he sent a young man to take me into the courtyard where the forging shops were located. To one of them, the latter went to deliver the master's order. — The razors are all forged here under two hammers, which have a not altogether flat and rounded face all the way around. The <term ref="gfa-keywords-8658">anvil</term> is exceedingly simple, a square block, 5 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> wide, 12 inches long, almost <pb n="201" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557942"/> completely flat. The two short sides are rounded to forge the blades somewhat concave, just as the front long side is rounded in the middle, though only slightly, to allow the tang and tail to be added. They always have 4 to 5 rods in the fire and do almost no blowing at all. Also, they always forge two knives together, then cut them apart to an exact measurement that they make with chalk on the anvil. — With all their experience, they cut them so beautifully that there is no need to file. They also punch the holes while the blades are still warm. Two men cut twenty dozen a day, for which they are paid 9 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8463">pence</term> per dozen, which amounts to 15 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shillings</term> for both men, or 4 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">fl</term>. 24 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8444">kr</term>. of our money per day for each. — In our country, this daily wage would seem excessive, in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, however, it is not, since everything is almost two to three times more expensive. <pb n="202" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557943"/> When the razors, for which he had given the order that they should be made like those of "<term ref="gfa-keywords-9528">Silver Steel</term>", which is also known here, were almost finished, he himself came to be present at the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8561">hardening</term>, for which I was grateful. As I said, no filing was done on them, and they were hardened at once, with care, but without the slightest finesse, and tempered in the same way we do. When I moved a little to the side, I overheard the workers telling him how the steel had behaved during forging. — I thought the next step would be <term ref="gfa-keywords-8879">grinding</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9742">polishing</term>, except that no <term ref="gfa-keywords-9305">cutler</term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1265">Sheffield</placeName> performs these tasks, and rightly so, since there are large water- and steam-driven facilities that do so. — After lunch, I visited the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8097"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1982" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="95" cert="0">grinding and polishing mills</placeName></orgName> again, and now had a chance to see why the <pb n="203" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557944"/> English razor blades are generally so good, and not, as often happens, spoiled by overheating, especially during polishing. Overheating is nearly impossible due to the set-up of their grinder and the way it works. Not only does the polishing wheel, which is quite large in diameter, turn very slowly, but half a dozen razors are always put into the hilt and worked on simultaneously, so that as one gets hot, it is put aside and a fresh one is taken, thus, they are continually alternated until all are finished. I took one immediately in my hand as it came finished off the wheel, and it was not so hot that I could not easily hold it.</p>
                <p>They also hold the razor against the wheel in all directions during polishing, almost always lengthwise, and <pb n="204" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557945"/> this works well since the blade and tail are forged afterwards, and therefore, which surprises many of our <term ref="gfa-keywords-9305">cutlers</term>, there is no visible line. By the time the blades had returned, the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9023">ivory</term> handles were ready, since the measurements were taken before the blades were sharpened, and so they only had to be removed. Since Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7937">Rhodes</persName>, that was the name of the factory owner, was not present at the time, I arranged to pick up the razors, which had been finished in three hours after being forged, the following day.</p></div>

                <head>Weitere Fabrikbesuche in Sheffield, 30. Juni 1825</head>
                <p>I visited the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1984" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="96" cert="0">cast-steel drawing mill</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1983" cert="0">The Wicker</placeName>. Its equipment was not superior to the one in  <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>, except that it was driven by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term>. Because there is a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9337">sewing needle factory</term> in these buildings, the mill is also located here; however, it only draws thin <term ref="gfa-keywords-8994">wire</term>. In <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, they have the sen<pb n="205" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557946" break="no"/>se to use cast steel wire for their needles, so they have an excellent reputation. Incidentally, when the <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term> is thick, it tends to break, as English <term ref="gfa-keywords-8482">cast steel</term> is always more brittle than others; however, the clever system by which they can vary the tempo drawing process not only according to the nature of the material in general, but even at the moment of <term ref="gfa-keywords-633">drawing</term> itself, prevents much breakage and preserves the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9655">drawing plates</term>. — I went down to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1668" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="97">Don</placeName> late in the day, suspecting that <term ref="gfa-keywords-9245">rolling mills</term> must be located there. Before reaching the river, I passed a large building next to the bridge, with the English coat of arms carved in stone on its frontispiece, and around it the inscription: <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8322"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1985" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="98" cert="0">Sheffield Gas Works</placeName></orgName> and below it the rather fitting motto: Ex Fumo Dare Lucem<note>Lat. für «aus Rauch Licht erzeugen»</note>. As it was just being opened <pb n="206" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557947"/> and a worker was in the process of filling the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8882">retorts</term>, I went in. The interior was very well arranged. In a relatively small furnace there were 40 retorts, set up in such a way that each individual fire heated five of them, which were placed on top of each other in <term ref="gfa-keywords-9839">this manner</term>. Opposite these five were five more on the other side, so that the two competing fires came together in the middle in a chimney. From two ample main pipes, the gas flowed into the "Purificator", which, like the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8550">gasometer</term>, was not superior to the usual ones. The <term ref="gfa-keywords-9198">lime</term> is changed four or five times a day, and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8616">wigam</term> is used for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8967">distillation</term>, but ordinary <term ref="gfa-keywords-8474">coal</term> for burning. — The light seemed purer and more odourless than that in <placeName ref="gfa-places-471">Manchester</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Soon after, I encountered two such <pb n="207" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557948"/> <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8323"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1986" type="itinerar" when="1825-06-30" n="99" cert="0">factories</placeName></orgName> bearing the name <persName ref="gfa-actors-7809">Darwin</persName>, which I knew well. They roll <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheet metal</term> and thin <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term>. The cast steel sheets are rolled out of 9 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inch</term> wide and about ¾ inch thick <term ref="gfa-keywords-9510">ingots</term>. The pressure is so great and the steel so brittle, it seems, that inch-deep cracks often form on both sides, which must be cut away afterwards, causing considerable waste.</p>
                <p>The square, 2 to 2½ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8541">line</term> thick and flat <term ref="gfa-keywords-8660">penknife steel</term> is rolled from short, 10-inch-long pieces in façon as <term ref="gfa-keywords-9523">sparry-iron steel</term> and, of course, finished in a heating furnace, producing rods that are <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">9-to-10-feet</term> long.</p>
                <p>Night had fallen, so I did not linger any longer to avoid attracting attention and returned <placeName ref="gfa-places-2083" cert="0">home</placeName>.</p>

                <p><pb n="208" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557949"/> <date when="1825-07-01">July 1st</date>. This morning I went first to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1980" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-01" n="100" cert="0">cast steel factory</placeName> factory to pick up the piece of scrap "<term ref="gfa-keywords-9510">Ingot Steel</term>" I had ordered, as well as a few thin-rolled, rectangular rods of the same. As I expected, given the nature of the casting, the ingot steel was full of holes on the inside. ln some cases, this does not matter at all, but for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheets</term> intended for making <term ref="gfa-keywords-9591">watch springs</term>, it is most detrimental. — From the cast-steel factory, I took the road leading to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1989" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-01" n="101" cert="0">place where they make the refractory bricks</placeName> of which <placeName ref="gfa-places-1265">Sheffield</placeName> requires so many and which are so inexpensive, for a hundred of them cost 9 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">shillings</term> and 6 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8463">pence</term>, or about 3½ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8444">Kreuzer</term> each. Here, too, the advantages of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9302">mechanics</term> are applied, sensibly and with success. In our country the oven builders, after beating the earth into a heap, trample it down in a spiral line, <pb n="209" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557950"/> pound it and trample it again until it is ready. Here, they use horsepower. In a wide, round, shallow pit or depression lined with boards, stands a pole with a rotating head and a hole running through it transversely, in which a deep thread is cut. A long, sturdy iron rod with a shallow thread passes through it, and a high roller, standing upright like a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9433">grindstone</term>, is attached to it. A little further out, a whippletree is attached for harnessing a horse. — Now this pit or round box is filled with enough sufficiently moistened earth, and the horse is driven. As it circles around, the screw leads the moving stone in spiral lines closer and closer to the centre of the box, and the earth, which is extremely compressed by the heavy <pb n="210" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557951"/> stone, rises in narrow furrows on either side. When the stone is close enough to the pole, the horse is driven in the opposite direction, and the stone moves in widening circles towards the perimeter of the box, then reverses its direction again towards the centre, and so on, until the earth is sufficiently prepared to yield impeccable material. This is then hammered into the moulds like ordinary bricks and fired like all other bricks in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> in the open air, but not like them in open kilns, but in closed kilns, and with a far more intense fire.</p>

You have some excellent razors here, he said, and wrapped them up again. When I had paid him and was leaving, he said, "I should be glad to know little more of the history of that <term ref="gfa-keywords-9474">steel</term>". To which I replied: “And i shuld be glad to have a few lines from You containing Your opinion about it". — Without a word, he sat down and wrote the following, which, owing to the man's respectability, I regard as a kind of official document and therefore append to these notes in the original:</p>

                <p>All this he did, and honoured me with a, as I found later, very well written treatise on the manufacture, selection and treatment of a good razor. To this treatise was added a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper plate</term>, on which eight of the best, and in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> most common, types of razor blades were drawn in actual size. All this he did without asking my name or where I was from. He only asked that I send him a small piece of my steel, which he would appreciate. I told him that it would be done and that he would certainly hear from me. — I recount this incident, <pb n="214" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557955"/> as insignificant as it may seem, in such detail, as it seems to me to represent a striking trait of this nation’s character, which is expressed through disposition rather than compliments: refinement and benevolence.</p>

                <p> <date when="1825-07-02">July 2nd</date>. Early in the morning I went to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1991" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-02" n="105" cert="0">T. Mill</placeName>, where I heard from an old <pb n="215" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557956"/> foreman with whom I was walking while was waiting for someone else from whom I had something to order, about the actual process of making their hard <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">rollers</term>, for which, given the simplicity of the procedure, there is once again a profound reasoning, especially since the English <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> made with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">coke</term> is much more difficult to "<term ref="gfa-keywords-8755">chill</term>", as he called it, than ours. However, it was only after many failed attempts that they arrived at the sound principle which they now observe, and the application of which, especially in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-3621">rolling</term> of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">steel sheets</term>, is now so beneficial.</p>
                <p>After I had concluded my business, which was in fact simply a visit to an acquaintance, I returned to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1265" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-02" n="106">Sheffield</placeName> and again <placeName ref="gfa-places-1982" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-02" n="107" cert="0"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-8097"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7937">to Mr. Rhodes</persName></orgName></placeName>, to whom I felt I owed a debt. I took the English Journal, which I mentioned on <date when="1825-06-14">June 14</date> and <pb n="216" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557957"/> asked him to read the very short treatise. He did so aloud. When he had finished, I continued: "This Mr. Fischer, whose name is mentioned at the beginning of this report, is me, and the person who made the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9474">steel</term> from which you made the two <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razors</term> is also me. You were so obliging and polite to me, I believe the least I can do is to tell you with whom you had to do. In addition, I showed him a razor forged in my factory and hardened by me, which was damask. — He appeared surprised and said: I would not have believed that such razors could be made elsewhere, and that it is so well sharpened. — He added: I think the edge is a little rough, will you not allow me to "hone" it on the stone? — I realized that he was only interested in ascertaining the quality of the edge, <pb n="217" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557958"/> so I gladly agreed. The report from his worker must have satisfied him, for as I was about to leave, he asked me whether, since he was going my way, I would not allow him to have a shave with it at a <placeName ref="gfa-places-1993" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-02" n="108" cert="0">barber's</placeName> shop. To this I also agreed, and in a small shop with red curtains I witnessed the procedure, during which I was offered a chair and a newspaper. — The barber's verdict was very favourable. I decided to show him what our <term ref="gfa-keywords-9305">cutlers</term> can do, so I took him to my nearby <placeName ref="gfa-places-2083" cert="0">lodgings</placeName> and presented him with some beautiful razors made from the same steel. He looked at them admiringly, and I saw clearly that he had been cured of the delusion, which I am sure many still share with him, that the manufacturers in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1265">Sheffield</placeName> are the razor makers of the world. — He shook my <pb n="218" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557959"/> hand in cordial farewell, and so, the somewhat dull yet, for me, very important story of a razor comes to an end.</p>

                <head>Besuch einer Hufschmiede, 2. Juli 1825</head>
                <p>After lunch, I walked through the courtyard of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2083" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-02" n="109" cert="0">inn</placeName> to the office at the far end, where I reserved a seat to <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>. I passed by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9439">blacksmith's shop</term>, that had established itself there to serve the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9277">coaches</term> that arrived there almost hourly. A <term ref="gfa-keywords-8852">drilling machine</term>, simple and effective, like none I had ever seen at a farrier's, caught my attention. The long drill bar, which could be pushed perpendicularly up and down in two necks, and which has a square hole at the bottom to insert the bit, is cranked in the middle, like an ordinary <term ref="gfa-keywords-9623">twist drill</term>. Then, however, there is a support, as with a grindstone, on which one pushes and pulls, to exert greater force. At the top, which seemed to me the most important part of this device, <pb n="219" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557960"/> there is an old, heavy cartwheel used as a flywheel, which works well, since the upper part of the drill runs to a neck and not to a point. With a lever, like a bellows handle, the drill can be raised together with the wheel to any height. It sinks down by its own weight. Where there is space, this drill would be very useful for many purposes. — In front of the forge, lying on the ground, was a flat, cast plate six <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">feet</term> in diameter with a hole one-foot wide in the centre. They use it to level and straighten the rims and to mount them on the wheels. Anyone familiar with the work of a blacksmith will be able to appreciate how useful this tool is for such a purpose, as well as many others. — In the carriage house, I inspected the various pieces of carriage equipment, particularly the construction of their wheels and axles, and noticed es<pb n="220" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557961" break="no"/>pecially on the carts and wagons that it is almost impossible for such a carriage to be thrown off balance by getting stuck or bumping into other carriages, because the axle does not protrude beyond the nave and the camber of the wheel is almost equal to the protrusion of the (for extra precaution) semi-circular, rounded nave. — In the carriage house, I say, something at the very back caught my eye, which proves once again how the benefits that can be obtained from available power are used. — It was a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8939">horse engine</term>, that is an upright bar at the top with a cog wheel, and in the middle a bar extending from it with a whippletree, similar to what we have in our dyeing mills. When a horse is idle at home, it is quickly harnessed and used to cut fodder or chaff, since the aforementioned cog wheel is connected to another wheel on the well-known circular straw-cutting <pb n="221" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557962"/> machine, which has four slanted knives screwed between two iron plates that are driven around by a wheel work.</p>

                <head>Besuch eines Walzwerks und einer Frischschmiede, 2. Juli 1825</head>
                <p>— I wanted to see the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9245">rolling mills</term> again, while I had the access. The description of the process is of no interest to those who know it, and it is incomprehensible to those who have not yet seen <term ref="gfa-keywords-8509">bar iron</term> or bar steel being rolled. If one wanted to introduce this, especially where there is great <term ref="gfa-keywords-2998">water power</term>, beneficial method also in our country, then one would have to think of another method of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9246">heating</term> in those places where only <term ref="gfa-keywords-544">wood</term> or <term ref="gfa-keywords-8697">charcoal</term> is available, for it is extremely important that the <term ref="gfa-keywords-2965">iron</term>, which has been cut once or twice and then broken into short pieces, is brought to a perfect welding heat along its entire length under the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8740">fluting</term> of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">rollers</term>, as neither irregularities nor slivers can be remedied anywhere better than under the hammer. In another <pb n="222" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557963"/> conversation about the rollers with the master himself, the information from the old foreman was confirmed to me again. Namely, that they know how (with certain hand movements, which are so simple, but of which in our country few have yet to think) to make their metal just hard enough at the rollers that it can be turned with the best <term ref="gfa-keywords-8482">cast steel</term> instruments, making it highly resistant because of its hardness and tenacity. Not far from these <term ref="gfa-keywords-9245">rolling mills</term> was a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9056">refining forge</term>, where <term ref="gfa-keywords-2965">old iron</term> is refined on round plates of sandstone in a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8480">reverberatory furnace</term>. Twelve such plates of 75 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">pounds</term> each went into the furnace, and after the lapse of nearly two hours the welding heat was strong enough to melt them. Before removing them, the worker diligently sprinkled <term ref="gfa-keywords-2974">sand</term> on them on them, and then left the door of the oven closed a little each time. With a pair of thin <pb n="223" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557964"/> wide tongs, the lump was lifted off the floor and placed under a light lift hammer and compressed into a square plate about 2½ <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> thick. When it was done, it was put back into the oven and another lump was removed. After this was also compressed, it was transferred to the furnace on top of the other one, and this was done with all twelve, so that there were then six double lumps in the furnace. Now, strong and sustained melting heat lasting over an hour was applied, and towards the end of the process, sand was sprinkled on again, and then these lumps were simply pressed together under the hammer. The perfect smoothness at the top, bottom and sides convinced me that the welding heat, actually a so-called dripping heat, had occurred perfectly. — These lumps were now heated again and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9098">stretched</term> into wide bars <pb n="224" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557965"/> from which <term ref="gfa-keywords-8639">sheet metal</term> could be <term ref="gfa-keywords-3621">rolled</term>. — Considering the difficulties involved in producing <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8474">hard coals</term> to make it even passably useful, one must admire the perseverance of the English. But even now, for all their affection for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8474">coals</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">cokes</term>, they still adore <term ref="gfa-keywords-8697">charcoals</term>, and I had to smile when the good old foreman, of whom I spoke earlier and who had for some time presided over a charcoal ironworks in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1945">Wales</placeName>, referred to charcoal as a nice, sweet thing, full of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9227">carbon</term>.</p>
                <p>I was tired of watching and left almost disgruntled. Are we, I thought to myself, always to be imitators? Is it not possible for us to achieve something excellent and outstanding in the field of <term ref="gfa-keywords-3246">industry</term>, and especially in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-7828">iron and steel industry</term> which, judging by my <pb n="225" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557966"/> opinions and experience, is about to undergo a great and fruitful revolution? Do we never want to make ourselves strong by collaboration, and will prosperity never be added to wisdom and knowledge? — What are water and dust? — Two untenable, easily separable bodies. Yet does not <term ref="gfa-keywords-9373">porcelain</term> as a mass defy millennia, and is it not in its highest perfection as good as <term ref="gfa-keywords-9108">gold</term>? We now have more or less the keys to dissolve and bind the composition of bodies; yet are we always to hang them by the coattails only in relation to the meanest and yet noblest of all metals? There is 24 carat iron, like 24 carat gold!</p>
                <p>It was already late when I returned <placeName ref="gfa-places-2083" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-02" n="112" cert="0">home</placeName>. With pleasure, I saw the piles of food at the market and the crowd of workers who, with their week's wages in their pockets, <pb n="226" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557967"/> bought provisions for making a merry Sunday.</p>

                <p>Sunday, <date when="1825-07-03">July 3rd</date>. At 6 o'clock in the morning, I left in the "<term ref="gfa-keywords-9291">Mail-Coatch</term>" via <placeName ref="gfa-places-1917" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-03" n="113">Chesterfield</placeName>, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1257" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-03" n="114">Derby</placeName>, then <placeName ref="gfa-places-1912" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-03" n="115">Burton upon Trent</placeName>, so famous for its <term ref="gfa-keywords-8829">ale</term>, and <placeName ref="gfa-places-1987" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-03" n="116">Lichtfield</placeName> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-20" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-03" n="117">Birmingham</placeName>, 78 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> away, where I still had some business to conduct. I believed to have seen the church tower of <placeName ref="gfa-places-2010">Merishausen</placeName> in Chesterfield, except that it seems even more crooked to the eye. Incidentally, it is built using the same principles of optical illusion. The roof has the form of a heptagon, whose corners or bones, however, do not rise in a straight line, but in a somewhat curved line towards the top. The eye never finds in the horizontal line two points equidistant from the axis of the tower, and so the contour of the longitudinal section always appears concave on one side and convex on the other, and the tower consequently curved.</p>
                <p><pb n="227" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557968"/> The famous circumnavigator Dr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7423">Sparrmann</persName> was surely right when he showed me a reed organ pipe (Marsyas flute) from <placeName ref="gfa-places-1966">Illyria</placeName> in his <term ref="gfa-keywords-8394">cabinet</term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-142">Stockholm</placeName>, and then another similar one from the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1996">South Seas</placeName>, saying: "See how the human spirit sometimes crosses paths". The master builder of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2010">Merishauser</placeName> church tower was most assuredly not apprenticed in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1917">Chesterfield</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Near <placeName ref="gfa-places-1912">Burton upon Trent</placeName>, my traveling companion drew my attention to the wall of a stately inn, the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1999" cert="0">Bridges Inn</placeName>, on which was painted in equally stately fashion a side of bacon. The mischievous innkeeper promises the first young married couple, who can swear that they have never quarrelled with each other during the first twelve months of their marriage, an equally beautiful side of bacon in kind. So far, however, no lovers have come forward.</p>
                <p>At 5 o'clock in the evening, we were already in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>. I arranged <pb n="228" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557969"/> to have lunch as soon as possible at my previous and very good lodgings, <placeName ref="gfa-places-1997" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-03" n="118" cert="0">Albion Hotel</placeName>. In the dining room, or here "Coffee room", for it is used for eating and drinking, there were eight gentlemen each at a separate table. Two were asleep, one was reading the newspaper and five did not speak a word, so that I spent my Sunday quite in silence. After dinner, I wrote down the above and was glad to be able to rest.</p>

                <p> <placeName ref="gfa-places-20"><date when="1825-07-04">July 4th</date></placeName>. I had arranged to meet Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7945" type="met">John Sanders</persName>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9519">cast steel manufacturer</term> of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1265">Sheffield</placeName>, at 1 o'clock this afternoon, so I was only able to go out for a short time in the morning. I had made the acquaintance of this very respectable man in the "<term ref="gfa-keywords-9291">Mailcoatch</term>" to <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName> and he, together with his two brothers, is the largest cast steel manufacturer in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, exporting to both of the <placeName ref="gfa-places-250">Americas</placeName>. He was quite astonished that I <pb n="229" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557970"/> was able to give him such a detailed description of their production and process, from the preparation of the casting clay up to the point where the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8482">cast steel</term> is is put under the hammer, while he had not the slightest notion of my process. He began to believe, when I showed him my <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term>, the objects made from it and the testimonial from <persName ref="gfa-actors-7937">Rhodes</persName>, whom he knew very well, that this material, the production of which is still kept secret in England, can be made elsewhere and, indeed, just as excellently. In fact, he became so familiar with me that he told me the quantity of his weekly output, which would truly astonish anyone ignorant of the ways of the English. — They do not know how to make beautifully forged <term ref="gfa-keywords-8994">round steel</term> in England, and he does not know how to make anything of the kind.</p>
                <p>We talked about many things, as we soon recognized each other as fellow <pb n="230" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557971"/> craftsmen, and saw each other again in the evening, perhaps not for the last time. — I visited <placeName ref="gfa-places-1863" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-04" n="119" cert="0">Mr. Adcock</placeName> again. My ring of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9528">white metal</term> with the stone cut for it from the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8895">brownstone slag</term> I had brought him, was not yet ready. In a few days I shall have it.</p></div>

                <head>Über Sitten und Manieren, 4. Juli 1825</head> 
                <p>The workers in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName> prefer not to work on Mondays, as they do elsewhere. The streets and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9234">taverns</term> were filled with them. Perhaps now for one more reason, as an important question remains unresolved. I learned from Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7733" type="met">Adcock</persName> hat there is one, and only one, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9519">cast-steel manufactory</term> in all Birmingham, belonging to the banker <persName ref="gfa-actors-7742">Atwood</persName>. I went to see <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8324"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2047" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-04" n="120" cert="0">it</placeName></orgName> but it did not seem to me of the highest rank. I also went to an <term ref="gfa-keywords-1405">iron foundry</term>. The <term ref="gfa-keywords-9159">cast-iron wares</term> lying around on the outside did not impress me, and the inside conformed to the outside. It is hard to understand how <pb n="231" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557972"/> such good and bad things can exist so close to each other. I mention these things so that one does not think that everything is quite excellent, just as not everything is praiseworthy in customs and manners. Let the following be proof of this:</p>
                <p>In our country, when a tired coachman or farmer lays his head on the table and sleeps, people simply look at him and let him sleep. Here, however, a young, distinguished man, of the sort that the English call "Beau", and we, rudely enough, translate as Zierbengel ("fancy rascal"), came into the dining room with spurs nailed to his boots, which is quite unusual. He laid his hat, riding whip, and gloves on a fully set table, sat down next to it, and began to sleep. However, when this position was not comfortable enough for him, he pulled one of the beautiful armchairs (those who know the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1997" cert="0">Albion Hotel</placeName> know how exquisitely furnished it is) to himself, put his two feet with boots and spurs on it, <pb n="232" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557973"/> and propped himself up with his elbow on the table. — A short while later, he contrived another improvement: he turned the back of the second armchair towards him, flopped one foot over it down onto the cushion, while he let the other rest directly on top of it. He remained in this position as long as I was in the dining room. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7847">Hugo Grotius</persName> and <persName ref="gfa-actors-7933">Puffendorf</persName> have gone to considerable lengths to discuss all manner of cases as to what is permissible or impermissible, and where the law says nothing on the matter, but I ask quite simply, what would result if all the people in the dining room had wished to behave so? Such questions are quickly resolved in some cases, and in German-speaking lands and <placeName ref="gfa-places-48">France</placeName> they would probably have been clarified all the more quickly in that such an ill-mannered person would have been shown the door without further ado, regardless how distinguished he may be. Here, however, <pb n="233" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557974"/> no one said a word. — I was glad to have no further proper business to attend to after 6 o'clock in the evening, so that I could add various things to my notes which might have escaped my memory and with which I now concluded this day.</p>

            <div type="day">
                <head>Weitere Fabrikbesichtigungen in Birmingham, 5. Juli 1825</head>
                <p> <date when="1825-07-05">June 5th</date>.<note>Korrekt ist der 5. Juli, nicht der 5. Juni.</note>. This morning I went to a <placeName ref="gfa-places-2049" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-05" n="122" cert="0">manufactory</placeName> of melting pots, a product with which <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName> supplies almost the whole of <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>. They also make them for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9519">cast-steel factories</term>, but not for all of them. The process is the same as that in the cast-steel factories themselves. Here, too, they take to one part of new material double the amount of old used melting pots, mainly to protect against cracking and splitting. As in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9124">glassworks</term>, the old chunks of crucible are broken into small pieces by women, and the <term ref="gfa-keywords-336">slag</term> is carefully chipped away with a sharp hammer. Then the material is mixed by weight — the fresh <term ref="gfa-keywords-8773">clay</term> is <pb n="234" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557975"/> also completely dry — and ground to a fine powder on a rubber, whose upright rotating stone is driven by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term>, then sieved, moistened and also tempered by the machine or, trampled and pressed. When the pots are ready, they are dried in a very warm room, heated by an iron stove, and afterwards put into the kiln and fired, after which they emerge completely white.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, I paid another visit to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1858" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-05" n="123" cert="0">factory</placeName> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-56">malleable cast iron</term>, where I purchased various things. I was now quite convinced that a single and special type of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term> is used exclusively for this purpose and, in fact, only for this purpose. For not only did the present associate repeat to me what the other associate had told me earlier, <pb n="235" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557976"/> but for confirmation he had a piece of this iron brought up from the <term ref="gfa-keywords-55">foundry</term>, , broke it in two and showed me the fracture. This is a main characteristic for a trained eye in the evaluation of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term>, and so I was left in no serious doubt about its nature.</p>
                <p>Blue Monday<note>Bezeichnung für einen arbeitsfreien Montag.</note> must have been still fresh in the minds of <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham's</placeName> workers on Tuesday, for as I walked at quitting time along <placeName ref="gfa-places-1948" cert="0">New Street</placeName>, Birmingham's most beautiful street, in which a new building intended for a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8720">goldsmith</term> and jeweller, whose roof cornice is decorated with very beautifully carved stone figures, on which could be found the inscription ΠANTEKNHΘHKA<note>Griech. für «Haus für alle Künste».</note> (Graecomania, it seems, has spread to England), there were two crowds of people who had gathered for "Boxing matches", which, however, were <pb n="236" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557977"/> common business. — The reticence with which everything is done in England was also exhibited here among both fighters and spectators, and only when one of the former gave his opponent a powerful blow on the nose or eyes, did the latter raise a cheer of applause. How, incidentally, even people who do not belong to the common class can find pleasure in such a spectacle, can only be explained by the force of habit.</p>

                <p>The <date when="1825-07-06">6th</date>. This morning, after I had secured a place in the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9277">coach</term> to <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName> (there are three or four of them daily, as far as I know, in the evening, and just as many in the morning) for two <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">pounds sterling</term>, I went to the proprietor of the beautiful <placeName ref="gfa-places-2033" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-06" n="124" cert="0">house</placeName> with jeweller’s, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9138">goldsmith's</term>, art and costume jewellery, as well as <term ref="gfa-keywords-9102">iron goods</term>, and bought something of artificial <term ref="gfa-keywords-9343">obsidian</term>, which they know how to make very beautifully, and which is now very much <pb n="237" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557978"/> in fashion. — Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7874" type="met">Jones</persName>, as the owner is called, was pleased when I told him, judging only by what was on the ground level, that he had rightly given his house the <placeName ref="gfa-places-821">Greek</placeName> inscription, for there were truly objects of all manner of art, including <term ref="gfa-keywords-9292">painting</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8830">sculpture</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8642">bronze</term>. — Yes, he said, you must come upstairs with me, there are two more rooms. We climbed to the other two rooms up the marble stairs, which are covered with <term ref="gfa-keywords-8775">lead tiles</term> where you tread, so as to avoid slipping. — Of all things in the world, there must always be one that is the first, and so, I believe, in terms of the richness, quantity and beauty of the objects, it is with this one. Just as the lower room contains tea urns, tea trays, and a host of other objects for luxury and household use, so on the second floor is everything of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9108">gold</term> and also plated <pb n="238" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557979"/> work for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9560">tea</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-9552">table services</term> and jewellery, and on the uppermost floor, whose flat floorboard or ceiling is made entirely of coloured and painted <term ref="gfa-keywords-9861">glass</term>, there is bronze, painting, and ironware. I must show you something quite new that we have, he said, and opened a black case, which also bore the Greek inscription. It was covered inside with white <term ref="gfa-keywords-9452">atlas silk</term> and contained a pair of razors. This is <term ref="gfa-keywords-9528">silver steel</term>, he added, a completely new invention, Nothing comes close to this steel. — I had to smile a little at his astonishment when I told him that I had written a treatise on the subject four years ago. Here you have something completely new, I said, showing him a <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razor</term> of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term> that I had in my pocket, and the letter from Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7937">Rhodes</persName>, who also works for him. He wanted to buy the knife from me on the spot and pay very well for it, but for reasons well known <pb n="239" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557980"/> in England, I did not sell it. However, a connection had been established that could be useful in several respects. I went to pack my things, and in the evening at 7 o'clock I continued my journey from <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName>.</p>

Certainly, English legislation will know how to bring greater clarity and simplicity to these regulations, which are so complex and open to multiple interpretations. The <placeName ref="gfa-places-48">French</placeName> regulations are already much better, <pb n="240" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557981"/> but the <placeName ref="gfa-places-113">Austrian</placeName> ones are by far the best, the most straightforward and least expensive.</p>

                <head>Über Eisensteinporzellan und Kristallglas, 8. Juli 1825</head>
                <p>The <date when="1825-07-08">8th</date>. As I had often heard about the "<term ref="gfa-keywords-9022">Iron stone china ware</term>", which is supposed to be an almost unbreakable <term ref="gfa-keywords-9373">porcelain</term>, I went this morning to the <placeName ref="gfa-places-2032" type="itinear" when="1825-07-08" n="126" cert="0">place</placeName> where it is sold (<placeName ref="gfa-places-1700">St. Pauls Churchyard</placeName>). In addition to this and other types of porcelain, there is an extensive, perhaps the most extensive, collection of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9105">crystal glass</term> in the empire. The owner was very polite and showed me around the various rooms. I could not help but notice the extraordinary thickness and heaviness of the <term ref="gfa-keywords-9022">ironstone porcelain</term> which is unlikely to ever be in great demand. I had a completely different conception of it. The crystal glass was incomparably pure and brilliant. Among the many chandeliers he showed to me was one costing 350 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8536">guineas</term>, or over four thousand <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">Gulden</term> of our money, and then one entirely of green <term ref="gfa-keywords-9861">glass</term>, and standing <pb n="241" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557982"/> rather than hanging, of which seven similar ones had been shipped to a nabob<note>Nawab oder Nabob ist ein historischer Herrschertitel auf dem indischen Subkontinent.</note> of <placeName ref="gfa-places-67">India</placeName>, each piece at 300 guineas. There were wine bottles for <term ref="gfa-keywords-9372">port wine</term> at sixty Gulden a piece. To such bottles belongs a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term> table cart, such as I had seen in <placeName ref="gfa-places-20">Birmingham</placeName> in Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7874"><placeName ref="gfa-places-2033" cert="0">Jones' warehouse</placeName></persName>, which I had forgotten to mention. This cart, entirely of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term> and with wide wheels, whose rims are covered in blue cloth so that it moves quietly and smoothly, contains, in addition to the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8738">drawbar</term>, which is also of silver, and in general the front of the cart is very nicely furnished for handling, two "Bottl Stands", in which the wine bottles are placed. As is well known, when the tablecloth is removed and the ladies have departed, the gentlemen remain seated to drink, and the bottles are served to them in turn. A clumsy hand or <pb n="242" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557983"/> double vision sometimes causes an accident. Now, however, one no longer need touch these precarious objects, but gently guide them along by the drawbar and rejoice in the great improvement. — Since I am now on the subject of eating and drinking, I will mention two cases that took place while I was in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> just last week.</p>
                <p>Mdme. C. gave a déjeuner à la fourchette, for which merely the flowers that were placed on the stairs and in the corridors cost seven thousand <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">Gulden</term> of our money, and a Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7769">Hughes Ball</persName>, who bought from the <persName ref="gfa-actors-7970">Duke of York</persName> his estate <placeName ref="gfa-places-2034" cert="0">Oatlands</placeName>, 20 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8445">miles</term> from <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, for 160,000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8536">guineas</term>, held open table four days in succession for anyone who wished to come, without any restriction. The person who told me this also remarked that it had been in the public papers, which gives <pb n="243" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557984"/> the matter even more credibility insofar as it contains something that has taken place in plain sight.</p>
                <p>I spent the afternoon and evening with Mr. <placeName ref="gfa-places-2050" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-08" n="127" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7823">Egg</persName></placeName> in pleasant and stimulating conversation.</p>

                <head>Perkins Dampfmaschine, 9. Juli 1825</head>
                <p>The <date when="1825-07-09">9th</date>. This morning I visited Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7753" type="met">Perkins</persName> again in his rather remote <placeName ref="gfa-places-1850" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-09" n="128">factory</placeName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-2027">Regents Park</placeName>. As I entered, I heard a loud noise, repeated in rapid bursts, as in a cutting mill. It was the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engine</term> of 10 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">horsepower</term> now in operation. He led me to it, which pleased me exceedingly. It will soon be revealed to the public, when the facts will refute the misconceptions about it. — Several of the most excellent <term ref="gfa-keywords-9092">engineers</term> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> viewed and inspected it a few days ago and found nothing <pb n="244" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557985"/> with which to take issue. The movement of this machine is remarkably dynamic, and the piston makes 110 strokes per minute in the horizontally lying boot or cylinder of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8590">cast iron</term>, which certainly does not exceed 6 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">inches</term> long. The drawing, which I have at least seen and which I myself bought here in England, does not correspond to this machine. — Through a very small <term ref="gfa-keywords-8978">pressure pump</term>, which drives the machine itself, the oil for lubrication of the highly polished and glass-hard steel piston is continuously injected in sufficient quantity. The steam enters alternately at either end of the cylinder, and it is a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9094"><term ref="gfa-keywords-8673">high-pressure machine</term></term> of the highest calibre. — I wanted to demonstrate it right away in its full power, he said, and one cannot push it much further. — He assured me, incidentally, that in spite of this there was not the slightest danger. — The <pb n="245" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557986"/> "Boiler" and "<term ref="gfa-keywords-3491">Generator</term>"  are located on the other side of the corridor in an adjoining room, and the steam is fed to the cylinder through pipes wrapped with cloth at the ends. The flywheel of the machine is not large, and everything is generally very simple and plain. — Since there is such great prejudice against it, I do not dare to give an opinion regarding its present general usefulness and, consequently, its superiority over all known engines, but what I have now seen with my own eyes has nevertheless made a sufficient impression on me in its favour.</p>

                <p>As it was Saturday, I was obliged out of propriety not to stay with <persName ref="gfa-actors-7753">this interesting man</persName> as long as I would have liked, and left him to visit a large <placeName ref="gfa-places-2052" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-09" n="129" cert="0">establishment</placeName> for <term ref="gfa-keywords-8533">gas lighting</term>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term> and many other important objects, <pb n="246" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557987"/> in order to deliver letters of introduction from two friends in <placeName ref="gfa-places-134">Switzerland</placeName>. I thought at most to survey the workshops; however, the conversation with one of the owners quickly took on a far more interesting character than usual!

                <p>The <date when="1825-07-10">10th</date>. At midday I planned to visit the famous engineer <term ref="gfa-keywords-9092"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7936">Rennié</persName></term>, to whom I had a letter of introduction, but <pb n="247" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557988"/> he was not at <placeName ref="gfa-places-2053" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-10" n="130" cert="0">home</placeName>. In the evening, at 4 o'clock, an acquaintance unexpectedly <placeName ref="gfa-places-1710" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-10" n="131">arrived</placeName> with a proposition, as a consequence of which I might have had to go to <placeName ref="gfa-places-1773">Cornwallis</placeName>. We both took time to think it over. This circumstance, however, caused me to think of the possibility that it might be completely out of my control not to be able to attend the annual meeting of our <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8103">Swiss Natural History Society</orgName>, which I find so stimulating. — I felt it was therefore my duty to inform my two honoured friends, Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7927">Pfluger</persName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-1271">Solothurn</placeName> this year's President of the Society, and Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7954">Stierlin</persName>, President of our <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8102">Cantonal Society</orgName>.

                <p> <placeName ref="gfa-places-89"><date when="1825-07-11">July 11th</date></placeName>. At half past four o'clock, I went <placeName ref="gfa-places-2053" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-11" n="132" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7936">to Mr. Rennié</persName></placeName>. After a brief con<pb n="248" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557989" break="no"/>versation, he asked me if I would like to come to the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7582"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1636" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-11" n="133">Royal Mint</placeName></orgName> at 1 o'clock and bring some of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9474">my steel</term> with me for examination. He went on to say that there are always so many accidents at this mint with such precious <term ref="gfa-keywords-9330">dies</term>, and if my steel would hold up, we could do significant business with each other.</p>
                <p>At 1 o'clock I arrived at the new mint near the <placeName ref="gfa-places-1727">Tower</placeName>, where I met Professor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7483" type="met">Brande</persName>. I gave Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-8101">Parry</persName>, who is employed in the stamp office, a piece of about <term ref="gfa-keywords-8511">4-to-5-pound</term>, thick <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">meteor steel</term> with which to make the dies and requested that it not be handled delicately, as I myself would like to know how it behaves in this respect, in which it has never been tested before. We shall now see the result.</p>
                <p>Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7741" type="met">Atkinson</persName>, the mint master, joined us as well. It pleased and interested him <pb n="249" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557990"/> as much as the other gentlemen to see the beautiful <term ref="gfa-keywords-8452">damask</term> pattern on the <term ref="gfa-keywords-8971">dagger</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8659">razor blades</term> that I had brought with me. While we talked about them, we walked through the mint. Three <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">steam engines</term> perform the various operations. One, in fact, drives six pairs of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8767">rollers</term>, that are larger, however, than I have seen anywhere. I learned on this occasion where the best ones are made in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, though it is only at the mint that they are surfaced and finished. While they now roll <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term>, <term ref="gfa-keywords-9108">gold</term> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">copper</term>, and, something I saw nowhere else, apply oil to the rollers themselves, they still sometimes break them. Another steam engine drives the punching machine, twelve of which stand in a circle around it, while the third drives the eight <term ref="gfa-keywords-9328">coin-presses</term>, which stand in a straight line one after the other. Money was being minted for the <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7942">East India <pb n="250" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557991"/> Company</orgName> to send to <placeName ref="gfa-places-67">India</placeName>. On one side is the company's coat of arms, and on the other an Arabic inscription. Each of these presses is operated by a <term ref="gfa-keywords-9213">small boy</term> who places the pieces to be stamped on top. Below, the iron hand of the machine receives them and places them under the stamp by itself. Each machine delivers daily, invariably the same, like the strokes of a pendulum clock, 30,000 pieces, be it silver, gold or copper, for these presses are used for all three <term ref="gfa-keywords-4347">metals</term> alike. Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7741">Atkinson</persName> called my attention to the called my attention to the iron hand which pushes the round pieces under the stamp, but I was already familiar with it. This was invented by your countryman (he meant Mr. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7821">Droz</persName> of <placeName ref="gfa-places-1220">Neuchâtel</placeName>), he said. — Another new thing he showed me was the drawing or <term ref="gfa-keywords-9676">levelling machine</term>. It is, of course, all made of <term ref="gfa-keywords-8672">iron</term> <pb n="251" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557992"/> and <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">steel</term>, and the flat strips, when they come off the cutter, are then drawn through a flat hole, as one otherwise <term ref="gfa-keywords-633">draws the wire</term>, which consequently gives them a far greater uniformity than can be obtained by mere <term ref="gfa-keywords-3621">rolling</term>.</p>

Though it was late, the <persName ref="gfa-actors-7919">son</persName> of the <persName ref="gfa-actors-8100">Duke of Norfolk</persName>, together with another young gentleman carrying his broken arm in a stiff leather sling, came to buy some rifles at 50 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8536">guineas</term> each. Anyone who did not know these gentlemen would hardly have thought they had so much <term ref="gfa-keywords-8457">money</term>, for neither of them wore a piece of <term ref="gfa-keywords-9107">silver</term> large or small, on their coats, like my good traveling companion from <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName>, who obviously thought he would be held at <term ref="gfa-keywords-8907">gunpoint</term> <pb n="252" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557993"/> for it in <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>. Incidentally, this circumstance, which in itself seems insignificant, instructed me again about the circulation of money in England. — However, I must also note that with this circulation of money, one is tempted to say this waste of money, the people still have the scales in their hands. Something must either have the charm of novelty or the stamp of goodness on it for them to pay the right price, for something that any fool can make is worth as much to them as the compliments of <date to="1673-02-17" from="1622-01-15"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7488">Molière's time</persName></date>, or the titles of Spanish grandeur.</p>

                        Familien-Hotel</placeName>, denn so hiess das Kaffeehaus, zu wohnen, und musste also über
                    den sogenannten <placeName ref="gfa-places-1700" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="135">Church Yard</placeName>, um nach <placeName ref="gfa-places-1930" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="136" cert="0">Broad Street</placeName> zu gelangen. Die Fussgänger
                    pflegen auf den Trottoirs den Häusern nach zu gehen; in der Mitte ist das Gewühl
                    der Fuhrwerke aller Art. Von ferne glaubte ich schon etwas Glänzendes auf der
                    Strasse liegend zu erblicken und ging darauf hin. Es war eine kleine Brieftasche
                    mit stählernem Schloss. Ich ging sogleich nach meinem <placeName ref="gfa-places-1710" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="137">Logis</placeName> zurück und rief dem
                    Wirth nebst dem Aufwärter. Hier habe ich einen Fund gethan, sagte ich, bringen
                    Sie eine Schnur, Siegellak und Ihr Siegel; wenn wir den Eigen<pb n="254" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557995" break="no"/>thümer
                    nicht aus dem Inhalt ausfindig machen, so schicke ich sie auf die Polizei. — Der
                    Aufwärter konnte das Schloss mit verborgenen Federn aufmachen, und in der ersten
                    Abtheilung waren zwei <term ref="gfa-keywords-8410">Fünf-Pfund-Banknoten</term> und in der Milte Adress-Karten, aus
                    welchen wir den Eigenthümer und seinen Wohnort erkannten. Die andere Abtheilung
                    untersuchten wir nicht. Ich versiegelte die Brieftasche, schickte den Diener des
                    Hauses nach dem Eigenthümer und liess ihm wissen, dass er (weil ich wieder nach
                    der <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7582">Münze</orgName> zu gehen hatte) um vier Uhr sein verlornes Gut abholen könne.</p>
                <p>In der <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8136"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1834" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="138" cert="0">Apothecarys-Hall</placeName></orgName> brachte ich mit dem mir so schätzbar gewordenen Herrn
                    Professor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7483" type="met">Brande</persName>, der nun das Stempel-Departement und das mechanische Fach der
                    <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7582">Münze</orgName> statt Hrn. <persName ref="gfa-actors-7936">Rennié</persName>, dem seine grossen Geschäfte nicht mehr alles zu
                    besorgen erlauben, unter sich hat, eine halbe Stunde zu.</p>
                <p>Zum Zerreiben der Wurzeln, zum Aus<pb n="255" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557996" break="no"/>pressen
                    der Pflanzensäfte in grossen Quantitäten, zum Sieben der Pulver etc. wird in der
                    Apothecarys-Hall ebenfalls die rechte Hand aller Gewerbe in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName>, die
                    <term ref="gfa-keywords-8651">Dampfmaschine</term>, gebraucht; diese hier ist von acht <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">Pferdkräften</term>, von <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7571">Bolton und
                        Watt</orgName> gebaut. — Wir gingen wieder zusammen nach der <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7582"><placeName ref="gfa-places-1636" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="139">Münze</placeName></orgName>. Das wäre etwas
                    Wichtiges, sagte er zu mir, gute <term ref="gfa-keywords-9330">Stempel</term>: nachdem er mich eine kleine Weile
                    verlassen hatte und dann wieder kam: Nur diesen Morgen sind uns schon wieder
                    eilf zerbrochen, zuweilen gehen noch mehr zu Grunde, und wenn einer zwei Tage
                    aushält, so sind wir sehr zufrieden; überhaupt bekommen wir nie, auch aus der
                    gleichen Fabrike nicht einmal, gleich guten <term ref="gfa-keywords-613">Stahl</term>, und Sie begreifen, was dieses
                    für grosse Kosten macht. — Ich führe dieses als einen kleinen Avis au Lecteur
                    an, für solche, die es angeht. — Ich bemerkte lediglich darauf: die Probe mit
                    meinem <term ref="gfa-keywords-8453">Meteor-Stahl</term> <pb n="256" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557997"/> werde nun zeigen,
                    ob er etwas besser sei, versprechen könne ich nichts, jedoch dürfe ich
                    vermuthen, dass er nicht übel sein werde.</p>
                <p>Noch besuchte ich vor dem Zuhausegehen <placeName ref="gfa-places-2087" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="140" cert="0"><persName ref="gfa-actors-8085">Herrn Daniel</persName></placeName>, Secretair der <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8099">imperial
                    gaslight company</orgName>, der mir einige Exemplare der Fragen, die bei Unternehmung
                    einer <term ref="gfa-keywords-8533">Gasbeleuchtung</term> in einer Stadt auf dem festen Lande zu beantworten sind,
                    übergab. Selbige sind wohlgestellt, die Sache selbst aber scheint mir noch etwas
                    schwankend. Auf einzelne Etablissements lassen sie sich nicht ein, verwiesen
                    mich aber an die Herren <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7803"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7758"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7507">Taylor und Martineau</persName></persName></orgName>, die mir für die Vortrefflichkeit
                    und Simplicität ihrer Einrichtungen schon bekannt sind. Auf meine Aeusserung,
                    dass es sehr wünschenswerth wäre, dass man auf dem Continent, gleichwie in
                    <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>, das Gas in comprimirtem Zustande kaufen und in schicklichen Gefässen
                    verbrauchen könnte, sagte er: dieses wird schwerlich Eingang <pb n="257" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557998"/> finden, denn es
                    zeigte sich, dass das comprimirte Gas die helle Flamme nicht gibt, wie das in
                    natürlicher Spannung; auch kehrt das Gas durch die Compression wieder in einen
                    Theil von Oel zurück. Herr Professor <persName ref="gfa-actors-7814">De la Rive</persName> sagte mir schon etwas von diesem
                    höchst merkwürdigen Oel, welches aus gleichen Grundlagen, aber andern
                    Proportionen besteht, und äusserst flüchtig sein soll. — Diesem ungeachtet
                    möchte ich doch nach meiner Zuhausekunft bei einiger Musse die Sache nicht
                    unversucht lassen. — Um vier Uhr präcis war ich in meinem <placeName ref="gfa-places-1710" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-12" n="141">Logis</placeName>, und man deutete
                    mir bei meinem Hineintreten in den Coffee room auf einen Herrn, der die Zeitung
                    las und das von mir gefundene Portefeuille abholen wollte. Er übergab mir
                    schweigend die Karte, die ich am Morgen mit der Anzeige, wo selbiges sei,
                    gesendet hatte. Ich holte die Brieftasche herunter, übergab sie ihm; ich glaube,
                    wir redeten nicht fünf Worte. Er verbeugte sich ein wenig und ging fort. <pb n="258" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16557999"/> — Ich
                    dachte, die Engländer sind doch wunderliche Leute, und setzte mich zum Essen.
                    Als ich beinahe fertig war, kam ein Herr, der sich bei dem Aufwärter nach jemand
                    erkundigte und dann auf mich zuging. Er sagte, er sei die Person, dem die
                    Brieftasche, an welcher ihm sehr viel gelegen gewesen sei, gehöre, und da er
                    einer amtlichen Sitzung, ich meine er sagte in der Bank, habe beiwohnen müssen,
                    so sei es ihm unmöglich gewesen, um vier Uhr, wie ich ihm andeutete, zu kommen;
                    er habe deswegen seinen Onkel geschickt, um sie abzuholen, sich aber
                    vorbehalten, mir selbst zu danken. Er setzte sich zu mir hin. Sagen Sie mir nur,
                    wiederholte er öfters, mit was ich Ihnen in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> einen Gefallen erweisen
                    kann. Ich dankte ihm für alles und sagte, ich werde dieses Land nun bald wieder
                    verlassen, welches für mich, besonders in wissenschaftlicher und industrieller
                    Beziehung, einen so grossen Reiz <pb n="259" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558000"/> habe. — Die
                    Unterhaltung ging indessen bald auf das Wissenschaftliche über, und ich fand in
                    Herrn <persName ref="gfa-actors-7901">Paul Meyer</persName> einen in mehrern Fächern, besonders in der <term ref="gfa-keywords-291">Geologie</term>,
                    wohlbewanderten und kenntnissvollen Mann. Er fragte mich, ob ich <persName ref="gfa-actors-7791"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9677">William
                        Bucklands Reliquia Deluviana</term></persName> kenne? Ich erwiederte : in einer neuen Zeitschrift
                    habe ich die Anzeige, aber weiter nichts gelesen. Erlauben Sie mir , dass ich es
                    Ihnen zum Andenken sende. Ich nahm es sogleich an, weil ich sah, dass es ihm
                    Freude machte. Diesem fügte er noch zwei für mich sehr verbindlich geschriebene
                    Empfehlungen an Herrn <persName ref="gfa-actors-7730">Aikin</persName>, Direktor des <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8240">Museums der Künste</orgName>, und an Herrn
                    <persName ref="gfa-actors-7965">Webster</persName> für die Sammlungen der geologischen Gesellschaft, bei. Ob ich sie werde
                    benutzen können, weiss ich nicht. Die Zeit ist eben im Verhältniss des
                    Merkwürdigen und Lehrreichen so kurz, dass, wenn ich ein ganzes Jahr hier wäre,
                    ich schwerlich einen Tag <pb n="260" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558001"/> mit rother Dinte zu
                    bezeichnen hätte. Eine Viertelstunde nachher erhielt ich dieses prächtige und
                    klassische Werk, und brachte den Rest des Abends mit Beschauung der zahlreichen
                    Kupfertafeln und Karten zu.</p></div>

                    kann. Ich dankte ihm für alles und sagte, ich werde dieses Land nun bald wieder
                    verlassen, welches für mich, besonders in wissenschaftlicher und industrieller
                    Beziehung, einen so grossen Reiz <pb n="259" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558000"/> habe. — Die
                    Unterhaltung ging indessen bald auf das Wissenschaftliche über, und ich fand in
                    Herrn <persName ref="gfa-actors-7901">Paul Meyer</persName> einen in mehrern Fächern, besonders in der <term ref="gfa-keywords-291">Geologie</term>,
                    wohlbewanderten und kenntnissvollen Mann. Er fragte mich, ob ich <persName ref="gfa-actors-7791"><term ref="gfa-keywords-9677">William
                        Bucklands Reliquia Deluviana</term></persName> kenne? Ich erwiederte : in einer neuen Zeitschrift
                    habe ich die Anzeige, aber weiter nichts gelesen. Erlauben Sie mir , dass ich es
                    Ihnen zum Andenken sende. Ich nahm es sogleich an, weil ich sah, dass es ihm
                    Freude machte. Diesem fügte er noch zwei für mich sehr verbindlich geschriebene
                    Empfehlungen an Herrn <persName ref="gfa-actors-7730">Aikin</persName>, Direktor des <orgName ref="gfa-actors-8240">Museums der Künste</orgName>, und an Herrn
                    <persName ref="gfa-actors-7965">Webster</persName> für die Sammlungen der geologischen Gesellschaft, bei. Ob ich sie werde
                    benutzen können, weiss ich nicht. Die Zeit ist eben im Verhältniss des
                    Merkwürdigen und Lehrreichen so kurz, dass, wenn ich ein ganzes Jahr hier wäre,
                    ich schwerlich einen Tag <pb n="260" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558001"/> mit rother Dinte zu
                    bezeichnen hätte. Eine Viertelstunde nachher erhielt ich dieses prächtige und
                    klassische Werk, und brachte den Rest des Abends mit Beschauung der zahlreichen
                    Kupfertafeln und Karten zu.</p></div>

                <p>Den <date when="1825-07-13">13. Juli</date>. Vormittags war ich in besondern Geschäften <placeName ref="gfa-places-2028" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-13" n="142"><orgName ref="gfa-actors-7803">bei den Herren Martineau
                    und Taylor</orgName></placeName>, und dann später <placeName ref="gfa-places-1850" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-13" n="143"><persName ref="gfa-actors-7753">bei Herrn Perkins</persName></placeName>. Dieser sagte mir, dass er heute
                    gerade wieder ein besonderes Experiment mit seiner <term ref="gfa-keywords-9094">Dampfmaschine</term> mache, um es
                    noch seinem <term ref="gfa-keywords-239">Patent</term> einzuverleiben. Ich wünschte ihm den besten Erfolg, um seiner
                    und der Wissenschaft willen, denn noch ist der Streit über diese auf alle Fälle
                    eigene Idee gross, und da so gewichtige Kämpfer einander gegenüber stehen, so
                    muss man noch den Erfolg abwarten.</p>
                <p>Ich kam von dem weiten Weg, und nachdem ich unterwegs bei der <placeName ref="gfa-places-2167">Börse</placeName> einen sehr
                    guten, garantirten, mit <persName ref="gfa-actors-7827">Fahrenheits</persName> und <persName ref="gfa-actors-7935">Reaumurs</persName> Scale versehenen, zum Ge<pb n="261" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558002" break="no"/>brauch für Flüssigkeiten eingerichteten Thermometer für den geringen Preis von

                    nicht so leicht, aber dieses Mal doch, besonders weil es noch um Essenszeit (5
                    Uhr) war, über die langsame Bedienung der Kellner ungehalten, in Vergleich, wie
                    man bei <placeName ref="gfa-places-2054" cert="0">Very</placeName> oder einem andern guten Speisewirth in <placeName ref="gfa-places-118">Paris</placeName> das Verlangte fast
                    augenblicklich erhält.</p>
                <p>Ich ging noch einmal aus, um die von dem berühmten <persName ref="gfa-actors-7936">Rennié</persName> gebaute eiserne <placeName ref="gfa-places-2116" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-13" n="145">Brücke</placeName>
                    über die <placeName ref="gfa-places-1641">Themse</placeName> zu sehen. Diese Brücke und alle andern Brücken <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">Londons</placeName>, und die

                    durch seine Menge zum Gewöhnlichen wird.</p></div>
            <div type="day">
                <head>Besichtigung eines Gaswerks in London, 14. Juli 1825</head>
                <p><pb n="262" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558003"/> Den <date when="1825-07-14">14. Juli</date>. So sehr ich wegen der Menge noch zu berichtigender Geschäfte und
                    der nahe bevorstehenden Abreise in meiner Zeit beschränkt war, so wollte ich
                    doch die Güte meines Freundes, Herrn <persName ref="gfa-actors-7952">Smith</persName>, der einer der Directoren des
                    <placeName ref="gfa-places-2154" type="itinerar" when="1825-07-14" n="146" cert="0">Etablissements</placeName> für tragbares <term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">Oelgas</term> ist, und von dem ich eine Eintrittskarte
                    nebst Empfehlung erhielt, nicht unbenutzt lassen, diese merkwürdige Anstalt zu
                    sehen, und in der That fand ich sie merkwürdig genug. Das Gas wird in sechs
                    geraden und neben einander liegenden <term ref="gfa-keywords-8882">Retorten</term>, oder eigentlicher zu reden,
                    Cylindern, die mit beiden Enden auf den zwei langen Seiten des Ofens
                    hinausragen, und die mit aufgeschraubten Deckeln während der <term ref="gfa-keywords-8967">Destillation</term>
                    luftdicht verschlossen sind, nach der gewöhnlichen Art, das heisst, durch zartes
                    Hineintropfen des Oels auf der einen Seite auf die im Cylinder befindlichen
                    <term ref="gfa-keywords-8551">Coks</term>, und <pb n="263" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558004"/> nach seiner Zersetzung durch Aufsteigen des Gases auf der andern Seite,
                    bereitet. Wenn selbiges nach seinem zweiten Durchgang durch das Oelreservoir,
                    welches gewissermassen als Reinigungsapparat dient, in den <term ref="gfa-keywords-8550">Gazometer</term> getreten
                    ist, so wird es dann, wovon ich sogleich reden werde, in das Compressionsgefäss
                    gebracht. — Vorher aber muss ich noch einmal auf die äusserst verständige
                    Einrichtung dieser Retorten oder Cylinder zurückkommen. — Da sie ganz gerade und
                    an beiden Enden offen sind, können sie nicht nur weit genauer gleich stark
                    gegossen werden, sondern das Füllen, Leeren und Reinigen derselben geschieht mit
                    grösster Leichtigkeit, und die Construction des Ofens wird einfacher, und weil
                    sie beinahe die doppelte Länge der gewöhnlichen haben, dürfen sie bei gleichem
                    cubischen Inhalt einen um den vierten Theil kleinern Durchmesser haben, welches
                    für das schnelle und gleichförmige Durchdrin<pb n="264" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558005" break="no"/>gen der
                    Hitze sehr vortheilhaft ist. Eine von den Herren <orgName ref="gfa-actors-7803">Taylor und Martineau</orgName> in <placeName ref="gfa-places-89">London</placeName>
                    verfertigte äusserst niedliche und compendiöse <term ref="gfa-keywords-8673">Hochdruckdampfmaschine</term> von sechs
                    <term ref="gfa-keywords-8588">Pferdestärken</term> setzt die Kolben von sechs als Saug- und Druckwerk functionirenden
                    Pumpen in Bewegung, die das Gas aus dem Gazometer ansaugen, und es in den in dem
                    Füllzimmer, welches sehr geräumig ist, stehenden grossen, wie es mir schien, von
                    sehr starkem <term ref="gfa-keywords-8643">Kupfer</term> gemachten Reservoir, oder wenn ich den Ausdruck gebrauchen
                    darf, Windkessel einpressen. Ein einen <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">Zoll</term> im Durchmesser haltender <term ref="gfa-keywords-8783">Barometer</term>
                    steht mit dem in dem Reservoir comprimirten Gas in Verbindung, und zeigt seine
                    jedesmalige Spannung und seine Fluctuation. Vor diesem Reservoir stehen zwei
                    lange Tische, mit zwei parallel neben einander darauf liegenden Röhren, die sich
                    gegen den Reservoir in eine vereinigen, und sich mit dem Reservoir
                    verbinden.</p>
                <p><pb n="265" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558006"/> Zwischen diesen Hauptröhren und dem Reservoir sind indessen Hahnen angebracht,
                    damit die innere Communikation abgeschlossen oder hergestellt werden kann. — Auf
                    diesen langen auf den Tischen hinlaufenden Röhren sind dann in gleichen
                    Entfernungen von einander noch kurze, aber auch mit einem Hahn und dann oben
                    noch mit einem <term ref="gfa-keywords-8779">Schraubengewind</term> versehene Röhren, zusammen 48 an der Zahl, auf
                    welche man dann die zu füllenden Cylinder und Kugeln aufschraubt. Nun werden die
                    Hahnen alle schnell geöffnet, das Gas tritt hinein und so wie man von der
                    <term ref="gfa-keywords-9304">Memnonssäule</term> sagt, so ertönen alle diese Gefässe wunderbar. Sobald der Barometer
                    anzeigt, dass die allgemeine Spannung, welches innerhalb nur wenigen Minuten
                    geschieht, auf 30 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8962">Atmosphären</term> gesteigert ist, werden die Hahnen geschlossen, die
                    Gefässe abgeschraubt, auf Karren geladen und in die Kundenhäuser geführt. Andere
                    Gefässe <pb n="266" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558007"/> werden wieder aufgeschraubt und gefüllt, und so alle Tage circa 6000 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">Cubicfuss</term>
                    von diesem <term ref="gfa-keywords-8704">Gas</term> versendet. — Man wird fragen : sind die Gefässe, wenn das Gas
                    einströmt, luftvoll oder luftleer? — Sie sind luftvoll, so dass also ein
                    dreissigster Theil atmosphärischer Luft mit dem Oelgas sich verbindet; aber weit
                    entfernt, zu schaden, da dieses Verhältniss durchaus kein Explosivgas bildet,
                    ist diese Verbindung nützlich, weil der Antheil <term ref="gfa-keywords-9421">Sauerstoff</term>, der in der
                    atmosphärischen Luft enthalten ist, die Flamme von Gas mit hellerm Glanze
                    brennen macht. — Die Gefässe werden alle, ehe man sie gebraucht, einer Pression
                    von 50 Atmosphären ausgesetzt, und wann sie diese Probe halten, gestempelt.</p></div>

                    kann selbige doch gewiss gefahrlos für manchen andern Zweck statt haben,

                    Bahnen laufen, und dessen Seitenwände mit 6 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">Zoll</term> von einander abstehenden, etwas
                    schief laufenden und circa 1½ Zoll breiten hölzernen Rippen bekleidet sind, wird
                    nun der Block in einer Höhe, dass er über den Wendelbaum der Säge hergeht, den
                    Zähnen derselben präsentirt. Stellschrauben determiniren und fixiren seine
                    Richtung, so dass man sagen kann, die Fournire werden mit mathematischer
                    Genauigkeit geschnitten; das Vorschreiten des Blocks, von welchem Blätter von
                    jeder Länge und Breite, und von <formula rend="inline" notation="tex">\frac{1}{4}</formula> Zoll bis auf nur <formula rend="inline" notation="tex">\frac{1}{13}</formula> Zoll dick, geschnitten
                    werden können, geschieht durch den bei allen Sagemühlen gebräuchlichen
                    Mechanismus. Noch muss ich die Befestigung des Blocks erwähnen: er wird nämlich
                    an die vorher erwähnten Seitenrippen des Wagens, dessen <pb n="272" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558013"/> ganze Seite
                    weggehoben und nach Belieben eine andere hingethan werden kann, angeleimt. — Der
                    vortreffliche Leim, das Wärmen des Blocks auf der anzuleimenden Seite, und eine
                    grosse Pressung machen es möglich, dass, was kaum denkbar scheint, der schwerste
                    Block auf den Wagen gebracht werden kann. Wenn man diese Einrichtung gesehen
                    hat, da zu jeder Säge nur ein Mann ist und gewiss für zehn die Arbeit geschieht,
                    so kann man begreifen, warum Herr <persName ref="gfa-actors-7771">Brunel</persName> sich ein Patent auf seine Erfindung
                    geben liess, und warum überhaupt der Zutritt nicht leicht ist, denn eine
                    grössere Oeconomie an Zeit und an <term ref="gfa-keywords-544">Holz</term>, und eine grössere Genauigkeit und
                    Brauchbarkeit des Produkts lässt sich nicht denken.</p>
                <p>Eines Naturwunders, wie es mir vorkam, von Holz, muss ich noch gedenken. Nämlich
                    ein ganz fehlerloses Stück von <term ref="gfa-keywords-8774">Mahagonyholz</term>, nicht einmal ganz aus dem Herzen
                    des Baums 16 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">Fuss</term> lang, durchaus gleich, 5 Fuss breit und 12 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8460">Zoll</term> dick, war
                    hier, um in Fournire zerschnitten zu werden. Ich mass es selbst, um völlige
                    Gewissheit seiner Grösse zu haben. Wenn man nun bedenkt, dass der Quadratfuss
                    Mahagonyholz, von einem Zoll Dicke, von <pb n="273" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558014"/> einem <term ref="gfa-keywords-8443">Schilling</term> bis
                    zu einer <term ref="gfa-keywords-8536">Guinee</term>, wenn das Holz ganz ausgezeichnet schön ist, verkauft wird, und
                    dass dieses einzige Stück 960 <term ref="gfa-keywords-8449">Quadratschuhe</term>, oder 80 Cubikschuhe enthalt, so
                    kann man leicht die Rechnung des Werthes davon anstellen, so wie sich auch eine
                    approximative Idee von dem Riesenhaften des Baumes machen, von dem es herkommt,
                    und von welchem die Urwälder der neuen Welt noch Tausende enthalten. Die Blatt-
                    oder Zahnsegmente werden ohne die grösste Noth nie losgeschraubt, bis sie ganz
                    abgenutzt sind. Man schleift die Zähne, wenn es nöthig ist, auf ihren Spitzen,
                    dass sie wieder ganz rund laufen, und feilt sie nach hinten zu. Ein glücklicher
                    Zufall wollte, dass ich mit einem Herrn nach <placeName ref="gfa-places-2031">Battersea</placeName> fuhr, der kürzlich eine
                    ähnliche Einrichtung, aber um <term ref="gfa-keywords-9679">Fassdauben</term> zu schneiden, in <placeName ref="gfa-places-48">Frankreich</placeName> etablirt
                    hat, und sich, da sie gleich die gehörige Krümmung und Fuge erhalten, dafür
                    brevetiren lassen. Wann werden wir bei uns auch nur einmal eine Anstalt für
                    Dachlatten zu schneiden bekommen?</p>
                <p>Mit Abschiedsbesuchen und dem Einkauf verschiedener Gegenstände bis Abends spät
                    beschäftigt, brachte ich noch die wenigen <pb n="274" facs="https://www.e-rara.ch/ebs/content/zoom/16558015"/> Stunden bis um
                    Mitternacht in Gesellschaft meiner <placeName ref="gfa-places-131">Schafhauser</placeName> Freunde zu, die mich noch
                    besuchten und die es nie bereuen werden, in <placeName ref="gfa-places-41">England</placeName> gewesen zu sein, so wie ich
                    nun selbst das frohe Bewusstsein mit nach Hause nehme, alle meine Zwecke
                    erreicht und mir und Andern nützend, auch diesen Abschnitt meines Lebens nicht
                    umsonst durchgelebt zu haben.</p></div>

                    eine solche Einrichtung der Anstand, die Reinlichkeit und die Gesundheit
                    erfordert, ist hier beisammen, und sie könnten als Muster für die Bäder des
                    festen Landes dienen. Ein jedes Bad enthält zwei Zimmer, das eigentliche
                    Badzimmer und dann das, durch eine Thür davon geschiedene Ankleide- und
